"""The driver's part in a nav lane change on a Tesla. openpilot can't signal on that port, so turnpilotd prompts
"signal left" (turnpilotPlan.signalPrompt) and the driver works the stalk; DesireHelper then makes the change. The
stalk stays on until the change is made, then cancels as the wheel straightens, or goes off if the prompt does.
The prompt comes with the warning (turnpilotPlan.laneChangeCountdown); the driver waits for the countdown to run out
before working the stalk, as a driver who lets it run would, so the countdown runs in the sim. A blinker during the
countdown is the go-ahead early (lane_planner.py), which would skip it."""

    stood STOPPED_TAP_S (counted from the stop, not the prompt: a dwell longer than that gets its tap with the prompt);
  - unprotectedTurnGo: held at an unprotected turn's hold line for the driver's go: once the car has stood
    STOPPED_TAP_S, as a driver who has looked across (this driver doesn't look: the detector's oncoming hold after the
    go is what it exercises);
  - signalGo: a signal whose light TurnPilot hasn't checked: only when the ground-truth light (the bridge's own reading
    of the game) is green, once the car has stood STOPPED_TAP_S, never on red, yellow or a light it can't read;
    signal_tap False never taps it (the stop-at-the-line runs);
  - stall, only with stall_tap (exploring by hand, never a scored run): standing engaged STALL_S with nothing held and no
    prompt (plan not holding, no shouldStop): the model stopped on its own. TurnPilot's own carStoppedGo prompt for that
    (turnpilotd.py) is never tapped otherwise: a scored run's car left standing stays a failure to see. Off, a car left standing (no pull-away after a
    hold let go, as BeamNG ped_crosswalk_right did) is the run's failure to see, not the driver's to push on, and a push
    in a queue would drive the car at the lead (scenarios/score.py fails a press TurnPilot asked no go for).
  Never while TurnPilot holds the car for anything else: a pedestrian, the stop sign's dwell. And never while TurnPilot
  isn't acting, whatever its prompt says: a handback (plan.handback), unavailable (the detector not started, or handed
  back), a fault, or no fresh plan (older than hooks.PLAN_MAX_AGE_S, as selfdrived takes it): a tap under way stops, and
