"""Timing for scenario actors: where a walking mannequin is, when a walker starts and when oncoming cars go, and the
timestamps of a BeamNG AI script. Pure functions of positions (BeamNG world meters, x east, y north) and speeds, and
GoWatch, which follows the car at its junction.

On the signal tiles every scenario junction has a mapped signal, and the car stands at its line (BeamNG smoke 2026-10-28:
11-27 m out) until the driver's go. So the actors key on the car at the junction, not on its distance to the hold line:
the walker sets off on the car's go, and the oncoming cars go a fixed time after the car stands at its hold there, so the
first reaches the junction arrive_after s after the go (the sim driver's tap, driver.STOPPED_TAP_S after the stop).
