"""Map stop control: stop signs, yields and traffic signals on the route (navInstruction.controls), turned into stops.

TurnPilot stops for them from the map. For stop signs the evidence is sim only: in BeamNG (2026-10-27) the driving model
came to a full stop at 2 of 8. It stopped at 0 of 31 reds there too, a count that says nothing about real roads: BeamNG
renders a red lamp salmon (hue 18-20 deg, saturation 0.31-0.33, against 349-354 deg and 0.67-0.83 for real comma four red
heads), and the fork's own light reader read no colour on any of 184 BeamNG light boxes (lights r2, 2026-10-30). On real
roads, the 11-06 night drive: every signal stand was the big model's own hold, and given a turn desire it rolled a right
toward a mapped signal's line at 6.8 mph until the driver braked (1e 8:20.4, the light unread: below), the reader reading no
green in 667 reads and no colour on any governing head. Each control becomes a scene_policy.Stop, composed
with the pedestrian, oncoming and turn limits by ScenePolicy (its reason, holding and the accel cap's jerk ramp). It runs
every frame, whatever the route's maneuver is: a skipped turn or a straight-through junction keeps its stop.

The rules (Kellen, 2026-10-27; /private/tmp/claude-501/stop_design.md):
- The approach: a control engages within engage_distance (braking at MAP_STOP_DECEL from v, a second's lag, a margin).
  From then on a speed cap on a MAP_STOP_DECEL curve to the stop point, which only ever comes down (a cap that rises and
  falls with a GPS fix hunts), re-seeded only at standstill short of the latch (stopped in a queue: the lead leaves, the
  car creeps up to the line). An accel cap where the curve is late, never past MAP_DECEL_MAX (-2.0 m/s^2, the speed
  cap's own floor): a map stop never takes stop()'s hard-stop path. A stop that needs more than that, checked when the
  control is first seen, when the driver's gas comes off, and after a jump in its distance, brakes at -2.0 and says so
  (cannotStopComfortably, repeating while it lasts). Never harder, never silent.
- The latch (HELD): slower than LATCH_SPEED within LATCH_NEAR_M of the stop point (LATCH_PAST_M past it), the car is held:
  shouldStop, speed cap 0. The latch is the policy's and position-free: GPS fixes, nav gaps, reroutes, a skipped turn,
  a handback and a fault leave it be (turnpilotd keeps this policy through a fault). Only its release rule lets go, and
  only TurnPilot turned off clears it. A reroute's same control takes the latch over under its own key. A held car gone
  more than DRIVE_OFF_M at more than COMMIT_SPEED is let go: the driver's, once the hold has handed back (driverWent), or
  under the driver's gas (drivenOff); otherwise, with no go at all (the plan not applied: shadow mode turned on), an
  overrun. At a stop or an unprotected turn, the car past its stop point and past the furthest TurnPilot asked of the
  latch (a creep, a roll-up) by the latch's reach (LATCH_PAST_M) of the driver's own metres, at any speed, is the driver's
  too (driverWent handed back, else drivenOff under their gas, movedOff with none: an idle creep with the brake let off;
  owner decision (i), 2026-10-30: any movement TurnPilot didn't ask for). The driver's metres are those they move the car
  past both, with openpilot disengaged or under the gas (update()'s engaged): inside the ask they are TurnPilot's, whoever
  drove them, and with openpilot engaged the plan is TurnPilot's, so the latch's own stop carrying a car re-engaged rolling
  is never theirs, in whatever order the two come. A peek-creep past the line is never held again in the crossing lanes on
  a re-engage. At an unprotected turn so is a car the driver has moved this hold, past both or not, once it is in the
  oncoming lanes (ONCOMING_ENTRY_M before the junction as latched), or at the re-engage once a hold could no longer stand
  it short of them (from the re-engage's own speed as the latch's own braking takes it, reengage_stop_m): after the left's
  full creep the reach lies inside them, and the driver's gas inside a creep can leave the car too fast to stand short.
  The reach and the lanes are decided on the driver's own frame, a car too fast for a hold at the re-engage itself, before
  the latch brakes it: never let go engaged on TurnPilot's metres (skeptic round 1: a re-engage inside the creep let go a
  frame on, and openpilot drove the car into the junction), and never for good on a driver's frame's speed (skeptic round
  2: braked to a stand short of the lanes after, the car was free to pull away into the junction). Short of either nothing
  is let go (owner decision (a), 2026-10-30): a gas nudge inside a roll-up or a creep is TurnPilot's metres, a handback
  the car doesn't move from lets nothing go (the car is held, the handback said), and a re-engage short of the line goes
  back to the full check (c). The autonomous left's own hold after a withdrawn go (unprotected_left: hold_here, the latch already let go by the go) has the
  same rule there, its crossing said here (update()'s left, LeftCommand.crossed: Driven). A stop's or an unprotected turn's line crossed with no go
  (let go so, or overrun) is never silent (owner decision (b)): its take-control (DRIVEN_PROMPT) stays up, engaged or not,
  until the car is DRIVEN_THROUGH_M past the stop point (Driven), and turnpilotd misses an unprotected turn so driven
  straight past its junction (turnMissed). A signal's stop is the light's: a crawl under the gas releases nothing. The latch is never
  replayed down the road. A car stopped further out (a queue) isn't latched: the MPC holds it behind the lead.
- No gas go anywhere (Kellen, 2026-10-28; DESIGN phase 4, G1). Any gas press disengages (DisengageOnAccelerator, on by
  default): it is the driver taking over, never TurnPilot's go, and releases nothing. A hold TurnPilot has no rule to
  release ends in a loud handback, the car held while it lasts: a stop sign after STOP_SIGN_HANDBACK_S stopped
  (stopSignTakeControl, "Stop sign: take control to proceed"), an unprotected turn at once at its hold line
  (unprotectedTurnTakeControl) unless the autonomous left holds it. Releasing a control releases those RELEASE_SPAN_M
  past it too (the far side of a divided road), but never past the stop-sign decider's 'clear': each line has its own; nor
  across rail tracks (near_rail: a released stop near a mapped rail crossing releases nothing, and one near it is never
  released by another's), so a rail orphan's stop and the junction's either side of the tracks each stop the car.
- A held stop sign under the stop-sign decider (stop_go.py, STOP_SIGNS.md v3 SG4a, through turnpilotd; update()'s stop, a
  StopCommand): wait holds it with no handback while the decider waits (its reason and action shown), fault hands it back
  now (stopSignTakeControl, the decider's reason: its faults only), shadow (TurnPilotStopSignGo shadow or off, auto without
  its data, H4, H6, H8) is the 1 s handback above exactly as before, its reason saying why. Without a command it is shadow.
- One release path (held_control(), update()'s release, a (key, cause)): the autonomous left's go (cause gap) and the
  decider's (cause clear) let the latch go the same way, in the frame they are given. The latch's stop point moves on by
  update()'s creep, (m past where it latched, its speed cap): the left's creep for a view (CREEP_SPEED) and the decider's
  roll-up to its stop point (the map curve, up to its cap), shouldStop false, held again within CREEP_AT_M.
- A signal the route goes straight through adds nothing (Kellen, 2026-10-28: through greens without slowing; DESIGN phase 4,
  G1): no stop, no cap, no prompt, unless an accepted light source, or the camera's adding (below), reads red or yellow for
  it. One exception: the autonomous left standing at its line never goes on a red or yellow any source reads at its
  junction, mapped signal or not, nor while a stop one raised there is in force (turn_light); a route turn's signal is a
  through signal's since 2026-11-07 (below). Going straight the driving model's own braking is the car's red-light
  handling (every signal stand of the 11-06 night drive was the model's own hold); the map signal is only where a light is
  looked for. On the car the
  camera's reader is the light source that adds stops (add-only, TurnPilotCameraLights addOnly, the default since
  2026-11-06); in the sim the light oracle stands in for it, so a sim red still stops. A red is a stop on the MAP_STOP_DECEL
  curve, seeded where it is first read (the curve from engage_distance if it is further out), never harder than
  MAP_DECEL_MAX: one that needs more brakes at that floor, cannotStopComfortably. A yellow is decided once: stop when the
  stopping distance at YELLOW_DECEL after T_LAT fits (YELLOW_DECEL, TurnPilotYellowDecel, no more than -MAP_DECEL_MAX);
  otherwise committed, with proceedingOnYellow, and a later red never reverses it. A stop is released only by a steady
  green: an accepted source's (GREEN_STEADY_S), or the camera's (CAMERA_GREEN_STEADY_S, the reader acting) for a stop of
  TurnPilot's own (_camera_releases, below). A light gone unknown keeps it, and held with no light read for SIGNAL_UNSEEN_S
  it is said (SIGNAL_UNSEEN_REASON, "Light not seen: waiting for green"; turnpilot.signal_unseen once), still held for a
  green, never released by the timeout and never handed back (until 2026-11-07: signalUnseenTakeControl, "Signal not seen:
  take control"). Held, not let go to the model: a release at a standstill runs turnpilotd's no-move clock into its own
  handback while the model holds at the red, and a turn desire out has run a red before (SIGNAL_UNSEEN_S's comment); a
  light read again is TurnPilot's to release once more. The driver's gas never releases one.
- The camera's light reader (DESIGN phase 4 G2, detector/light_state.py, its heads in turnpilotDetections.lights) is a
  second source that may only ever add a stop. Its governing heads are associated with the signals (a head from
  CAMERA_ASSOC_BEFORE_M short of a signal's line to CAMERA_ASSOC_PAST_M past it is that signal's, the last line before it
  winning; a red or yellow no line takes so is the first line's ahead that the span from its nearer range to its read range
  reaches, camera_owner) and what it would do is logged on every change (turnpilot.camera_light_shadow;
  turnpilot.camera_light_unmapped for a red or yellow no signal owns). A red or yellow on any of a signal's heads is its
  red or yellow only where its movement's heads say so (movement_state: the nearest cluster's majority going straight or to
  the curb side, the far-side turn's own head for the unprotected turn), and so is its green; a red or yellow read under
  the reader's confidence floor (CameraLights.vetoes) raises no stop but lets no green and no red gone count where, were
  it a head, it would change that. In shadow (TurnPilotCameraLights shadow) nothing it reads reaches a stop, a cap, a
  prompt or a release: the one thing it gates is the autonomous left's go (turn_light, its red too: keeping the car
  standing where it is never brakes it), which at a signal needs a green read from some source
  (unprotected_left.SIGNAL_NEEDS_GREEN). That go only lets TurnPilot's own latch go: plannerd's lift, which overrides the
  model's hold, needs a green from an accepted source (release_light; turnpilotd.certify_go), so a camera green never
  removes the model's red-light stop. Its reader failing (lightStatus disabled: three failed reads in a row, still retried
  and read again at its first good read, never off for the drive since 2026-11-06) is a status line for the whole failing
  spell (lightSourceRejected, "Lights Unknown"), only where no other alert is said, so it never mutes a take-control,
  overrun or yellow alert: its onset chimed (CAMERA_OFF_REASON "Camera light reader failing: lights unknown") once a spell,
  again once the reader has read again and no sooner than CAMERA_OFF_AGAIN_S after the last, run down only where it could be
  shown (no map prompt, engaged); the rest of the spell silent (CAMERA_OFF_STILL_REASON). Above the lane planner's
  can't-confirm line and a keep's status line (hooks.plan_events), and its words over the lane planner's (turnpilotd: S2,
  review 2026-11-07, said once for 2 s it was lost). Add-only (the default) needs both keys, modeld's message not shadow
  and turnpilotd's own
  TurnPilotCameraLights addOnly (modeld's follows the same param): then a camera red raises a signal's light to red, and a
  camera yellow to yellow only while a yellow stop at it is still feasible (a yellow too late to stop for would commit the
  signal to go, and a commit outlasts a later red: a removed stop). A camera green or unknown never enters the light, so a
  camera red can hold a stop the oracle's green would have released, never the reverse. A stop of TurnPilot's own
  (camera_added: a camera red or yellow raised it, or a route turn's want of a green made it) with no accepted source's red
  or yellow in it (accepted_stop) is released by the camera's steady green once the camera's red has gone (or by a head that
  read its red in view and reading neither red nor yellow for RED_GONE_S: ControlState.red_heads), as by an
  accepted green (2026-11-06: until then, on the car, where no other source is accepted, every camera stop ended in the stand
  handback); an accepted source's red only by an accepted green. That release lets TurnPilot's latch go and nothing more: the
  model's own red-light hold stays in the planner's min(), and plannerd's lift needs an accepted green (release_light). With
  no green read it stays held, said (SIGNAL_UNSEEN_S): never a silent roll, never a handback since 2026-11-07.
- Since 2026-11-07 (Kellen: test builds act on what they see, a safety driver on every drive) a route turn's signal is a
  through signal's: only a red, or a yellow still stoppable, read stops it, and with no colour read the turn goes with the
  model. No stop for want of a green is made (turn_stop is never set: _signal_mode, _camera_signal), so the paragraph below
  is the build before for it: its marking of the turn's signal (turn_id), its green's TURN_GREEN_STALE_S and its red's stop
  stand; its want-of-green stop, its TURN_UNSEEN_S handback, the driver's go through it and turnpilotd's skips for a signal
  too close to stop for (signal_turn_late, signalStop) are gone.
- A curb-side turn at a signal (a right where traffic keeps right): it flows through only on a green (a steady
  green from an accepted source or the camera's, turn_go), and it never goes on a red it is reading. A red or yellow read
  for its signal, by any source, stops it at the line and holds it there until a green, or until none has been read for
  RIGHT_RED_UNREAD_S (the reader drops a red the car still faces for up to 1.3 s): its line says it waits for the green. A
  light nobody reads stops it too (turn_stop), and goes on the right-on-red procedure: a stand of RIGHT_RED_DWELL_S, then its
  go once turnpilotd's look says the way is clear for RIGHT_RED_CLEAR_S on end (update()'s right: nobody in its crosswalk,
  no vehicle seen closing from the far side) and no red or yellow has been read for RIGHT_RED_UNREAD_S and
  RIGHT_RED_UNREAD_READS of the reader's road runs, let go as rightOnRed. A red or yellow read for it again after that go
  while the car can still stop short of the crossing lane (a stop ending within RED_PAST_M of its line, the car short of
  the line or no faster than COMMIT_SPEED past it: _right_reread) brings its stop and its procedure back; past that the
  turn finishes. A seen crossing vehicle or a person holds it for as long as it is seen; never a handback, never the
  unseen-light line. The stand for a light nobody reads ends too once the turn is no longer TurnPilot's (TURN_DROPPED_S).
  The same holds at a junction the map has no signal for wherever the camera boxes a governing head there (_camera_signal).
  A right taken through an unread signal at the corner's speed runs reds
  (route 29's two rights and the 11-06 right: the driver stood 12-25 s at each, the lamps red in the video, the car's reader
  boxing no head; 11-06's right on red). Going straight keeps "no red read means go", and the unprotected left its own
  hold. The car reads no "no turn on red" sign, and its look is the forward cameras' tracks: a car far up the cross road
  isn't in it.
- A route turn at a signal (2026-11-06 night drive, 1e 8:20.4: the model, given the turnRight desire, rolled toward a mapped
  signal's line at 6.8 mph until the driver braked; at night the reader read no green in 667 reads, and no colour on any
  governing head, so a turn at a light can't rest on reading its red): the signals of the route's TURN maneuver's junction
  (update()'s junction;
  one mapped from PROTECT_BEFORE_M before it to PROTECT_PAST_M past it, or the camera's signal there, below), for a turn
  TurnPilot drives (driving_turn: not skipped) that isn't the unprotected left's (its own hold needs a green there already,
  turn_light: it keeps precedence at its junction), are the turn's (_signal_turns, ControlState.turn_id). Going, such a
  signal is a stop for want of a green (turn_stop): the curve from engage_distance, the latch at its line (the mapped line,
  else the junction less CONTROL_LINE_M), every rule of a red's stop, unless a steady green (accepted GREEN_STEADY_S, the
  camera's CAMERA_GREEN_STEADY_S) is read before the car is held; a green being read defers it until it is steady or gone.
  Held, a steady green releases its latch (the camera's: TurnPilot's latch alone, as above); with no light read for
  TURN_UNSEEN_S it hands back (signalUnseenTakeControl, TURN_LIGHT_REASON, "Turn at a light: take control"), held, never
  a roll, put off while a camera green that may still release it is being read (it releases at its steady time, or, broken,
  hands back that frame: never a take-control just before the car pulls away on its own); a red read there makes it the
  red's stop (its stand SIGNAL_UNSEEN_S's once the red is lost). The driver's gas through it releases nothing, but lifted
  with openpilot engaged faster than COMMIT_SPEED where a stop at its line would need more than MAP_DECEL_MAX, or past the
  line, it is the driver's go (driver_go, turnpilot.signal_turn_driven): no stop, no overrun, no light read to run, as one
  driven through disengaged. Only provisional (_driver_go): short of the line a brake, the car down to COMMIT_SPEED or a
  red or yellow read takes it back, the curve re-seeded where the car is and checked (turnpilot.signal_turn_go_revoked;
  review 2026-11-06: dropped for good at the lift, a driver who lifted to brake by hand and engaged at the line was
  pulled away on nothing read); it is the car's once OVERRUN_PAST_M past the line faster than COMMIT_SPEED, and slower there
  the car is held where it stops. Lifted short of that, the curve carries on, and a creep lifted past the line is held
  where it stops. A red's or a yellow's stop keeps its overrun (stopOverrun). Let go by a steady
  green it goes (turn_go) until a red or yellow is read, as any signal, or TURN_GREEN_STALE_S passes with no green read,
  moving or standing (a head lost from view, a queue at the back of a green: the light may have changed unread): then it is
  a stop for want of a green again wherever a yellow there would still be stopped for (beyond v*T_LAT + v^2/(2*yellow) and
  LATCH_NEAR_M; standing, anywhere short of its line), and committed, as such a yellow, where it wouldn't
  (turnpilot.signal_turn_green_committed). Marked only short of the latch's reach past its line and where a stop at its
  line is MAP_DECEL_MAX or gentler (said, turnpilot.signal_turn_late, and left to turn_skip, which skips a turn too fast for
  it); the window picks the first mark only, on a frame the signal is in it and has been on most of the maneuver's frames
  (JunctionLine.most: never on one frame's read), and a signal once the maneuver's stays the maneuver's however its
  junction's distance is re-read (it jitters metres against the line's). Unmarked, its stop for want of a green dropped,
  only when the route's turn moves on, is skipped or is the unprotected left's, unless held (position-free). stop_ahead()
  has its stop (never while the driver's go stands), so turn_skip takes the turn from it, never too fast. A signal mapped
  further back than PROTECT_BEFORE_M is no turn's: on both 11-06 drives each was the signal of the junction the route goes straight
  through before the turn's (1e maneuver 12, 1d maneuver 5: 34-42 m back, navInstruction.throughLanesDistance putting
  that junction 29-32 m before the maneuver point and the signal's stop point 11 m short of it, the turn a slight left at
  a junction of its own), the model's as any straight one's.
- A route turn at a junction with no mapped signal (2026-11-06, the real car: a right on red rolled through at a junction
  OSM has no signal for, the camera reading the red in shadow, the model driving the turnRight desire through it): with
  the camera acting (add-only), a red, or a yellow still feasible to stop for, read on a governing head associated with
  the route's TURN maneuver's junction (update()'s junction; the line CONTROL_LINE_M short of it, the association window
  as a mapped signal's, its near edge from PROTECT_BEFORE_M before the junction for a head no other line takes:
  CAMERA_JUNCTION_BEFORE_M, rails-3, review 2026-11-07, 1e 7:06's head read 9-12 m short of the line and a junction read
  1.5 m longer made no signal at all) and owned by no mapped signal makes a signal control of its own there (camera_signal, key
  (CAMERA_ROUTE, maneuver id)): every rule above, the curve, the latch, the green release and the stand handback. For a
  turn TurnPilot drives, so does any governing head associated with it, whatever its colour (unknown too, as every head of
  the 11-06 night read): a light is there, and the turn stops for want of its green (above), once the head is seen there in
  TURN_HEAD_RUNS road runs of the reader (one run's box, a streetlight or a sign, is no light) and where a stop at the line
  is still MAP_DECEL_MAX or gentler (said once if not, turnpilot.camera_signal_late). Not where a mapped signal is at the
  junction (its own stop is the stop), whatever the head reads, red too: one that governs it for the maneuver, still listed
  or passed, done or not (_junction_lines, JunctionLine.governs: the turn's, or in the junction's window on most of the
  maneuver's frames; review 2026-11-06: tested on this frame's live signals alone, a junction re-read further on, a mapped
  stop released by a green or driven through, or a handback's takeover made a second stop for want of a green 10-22 m past
  the mapped line, the car stopped again in the junction's approach; and a red read on the far-side head after a go through
  a line set back 25 m, a green, the driver's go or a takeover, made the camera's line 15 m past it and braked the car at
  -2.0 into the junction's approach, cannotStopComfortably. Remembered from any one frame's window instead, the previous
  junction's signal 34 m back, read once 6 m nearer through route_follower's 1.4-6.8 m jitter, made the junction a mapped
  signal's, and after a go through it a red on the junction's own head stopped nothing, said nowhere). One lost unpassed (a
  reroute's controls no longer list it) governs nothing. A red the gate refuses with the car short of the junction's own
  line and no line taking it is logged once a maneuver (turnpilot.camera_red_refused, error): a signal 30 m or less back of
  the junction, a mid-block crossing's or a near junction's too, can't be told from a wide junction's set-back line by
  where it is (MapControl.junction is false on both: the 11-06 drives' set-back signals, 21-25 m back of their maneuver
  points, read false), and a red on the junction's own head past it is driven through, said there. The junction's own line
  counts toward the mapped line instead (_turn_camera: a line set back 26 m has its far-side heads out of its own window): their
  green releases it, and their red, its own heads reading none, is its red (a red ahead of a line not yet passed stops the
  car at that line, takes back the driver's go), and so it is for a governing line the turn isn't marked on (a turn not
  driven: skipped, going straight on the model, or the unprotected left's; S1, review 2026-11-07: a line 26 m back, its
  junction's far head 41 m past it red from 166 m out, and the car went through at 13.4 m/s, said only in the log). Gone
  through on a go (crossed faster than COMMIT_SPEED with nothing to stop for: crossed_v), a line takes no camera red
  (_camera_adds): the car clears the junction. Nor where the unprotected turn's own hold holds the car at it (the
  autonomous left's go already needs no red at its junction, turn_light). Once made it stays, its line re-read from the
  junction each frame (dead-reckoned without one, frozen while held) until passed, released or overrun, or dropped
  un-engaged when the route's maneuver moves on to another junction. With no route at all (navd's message invalid for a
  spell) one that is stopping the car stays, engaged or not, and is the same junction's again under the route's next
  maneuver id: only its light lets a stop a red raised go.
- A mapped stop the camera never saw (row C11; STOP_SIGNS.md v3 SG4b) is stopped for anyway, the gentle error, and the
  decider certifies it as mapped; at its hold its approach's class-11 shadow evidence is logged (update()'s signs: the
  forward runs counted from SIGN_LOOK_M, their stop-sign boxes, the best conf; turnpilot.map_stop_signs), and SIGN_UNSEEN_RUNS
  or more with none is said as unseen (turnpilot.map_stop_unseen) for the replay gate. Nothing here acts on a sign.
- A yield caps the speed to YIELD_SPEED at its line and goes once passed, but only while its rolling test passes
  (_yield, STOP_SIGNS.md 2.7, row C5); one whose test fails becomes a full stop at its line (yieldStop), the stop-sign
  decider's like any stop sign, and its handback says "Yield" (YIELD_STOP_REASON; YD-01). One whose road outranks every
  crossing one (crossSuspect: likely mapped for the cross road) is dropped and logged. Such a stop sign still stops, and
  says the approach is unverified.
- The driver's gas before a stop sign is an override; when it comes off past the line moving faster than COMMIT_SPEED,
  or past where the latch reaches (LATCH_PAST_M) at any speed, the stop is dropped (stopOverrun), else the curve resumes
  from there (re-seeded, checked for feasibility). Past the line beyond the latch's reach with no release, at any speed,
  is an overrun: dropped, logged, alerted, never a stop in the junction with nothing to release it. Driven off a held stop
  under the driver's foot is the same.
- An unprotected turn (Kellen, 2026-10-27: the same rule as stop signs and lights) is a routed far-side turn (a left on the
  right) across an oncoming approach (navInstruction.maneuverOpposing present, or unknown: no junction data is never
  clear) with no stop sign of its own at the junction (one within PROTECT_BEFORE_M before it to PROTECT_PAST_M past it, not
  a rail orphan's with the tracks between it and the junction (rail_between): a stop sign already stops; the maneuver stays
  protected once seen so, after its control drops out behind the car). A signal there doesn't protect it
  (SIGNAL_PROTECTS_LEFT): a left on a green ball is unprotected. turnpilotd hands it in each frame (update()'s turn) and
  it becomes a control of its own, kind unprotectedTurn, at the junction's hold line less
  MAP_MARGIN_M, or where a signal is mapped there in the junction's mouth (SIGNAL_LEFT_HOLD_M, 2026-11-08: a left on a green
  ball rolls up to the junction and judges the oncoming lanes there, the signal's own control stopping the car at its line
  for a red or yellow read): the curve, the latch and the stop sign's rules. Held, it does what the unprotected left asks (update()'s
  left, a LeftCommand from unprotected_left.py through turnpilotd; TurnPilotAutoLeft): auto (the default; Kellen,
  2026-10-28, "No it has to ship taking the turn", no intervention) holds it, never handing back but for the left's fault
  (leftUndecidedTakeControl), creeps its stop point on to where the left asks (CREEP_SPEED, CREEP_ACCEL; still the latch,
  never past it), and releases it on the left's go (cause gap); announce and off hand it back at once
  (unprotectedTurnTakeControl), announce saying whether it would have gone.
  A failing or missing controls status leaves the turn unprotected. One the
  car isn't held at goes with its maneuver (skipped too fast, rerouted away, passed), never with a fault (it carries on,
  dead-reckoned); a held one is position-free like any latch. Its junction is the nearest of navd's readings
  (route_follower.py), so a new one can put the line behind where the car can stop at MAP_DECEL_MAX: it is never dropped
  as an overrun then (crossed blind), but moved up to where the car stops braking at that floor, no harder, said out
  loud (cannotStopComfortably), and handed back there like any other. scene_policy.py's oncoming and pedestrian holds
  only add holds.
- Off the route with a destination, the controls are navd's lookup ahead of the car (control_tracker.py), under the same
  rules. With nothing known ahead past the tracker's grace (off_route_unknown: the lookup pending, failed, unsupported,
  partial, or stale), the car never drives on silently: a speed cap comes down from its speed at OFF_ROUTE_DECEL to
  OFF_ROUTE_SPEED, and offRouteStopsUnknown says so ("Off route, map stops unknown"), for as long as it lasts. Never a stop:
  nothing is known to stop for, and the driver is asked to take control or wait for the reroute. Under TurnPilotAlwaysDrive
  the model drives on as stock openpilot would, with no cap: a status line with no sound (mapControlsUnavailableSilent,
  OFF_ROUTE_DRIVE_REASON) says the car won't stop for mapped signs or signals there, and nothing says take control.
- navd's controlsStatus other than ok (navd always sets it; none is a navd from before controls) raises
  mapControlsUnavailable and keeps "Map stops/signals: <status>" in the reason: no controls on tiles without control
  data is never shown as clear.
