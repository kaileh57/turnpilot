"""The lanes and the upcoming maneuvers for navInstruction, read from Mapbox-shaped route steps.

Mapbox and Valhalla (format=osrm) both put the lanes of a maneuver in two places: the sub banner of the step
before it, and the first intersection of the step that starts with it. Valhalla only adds the sub banner for
the last 400 m of the step, while the intersection has the lanes all along, so the banner comes first (it is
what Mapbox shows) and the intersection fills in the rest. A lane is active if it can be used for the maneuver,
and activeDirection is the direction it takes from there.

The junction of the maneuver is the first intersection of the step that starts with it, as Valhalla gives it
(format=osrm): the bearings of every road there, which one the route comes in by ('in') and leaves by ('out'), and
the maneuver's bearing_before and bearing_after. TurnPilot takes a maneuver as a junction turn only where some other
road meets it (turnpilot/route_follower.py), and its angle from the two bearings.
A far-side turn (a left on the right) crosses the oncoming traffic of the road straight ahead, if there is one: opposing
is present when a road other than the route's in and out leaves the junction within OPPOSING_DEG of straight on, none when
none does. A road one-way away from the junction can't be told from a two-way one (OSRM's entry is true for both), so it
counts: a hold too many, never one too few (turnpilot/map_controls.py). No junction data is unknown, never none. The opposing
road's mapped speed limit and lanes (maneuverOpposingSpeed, maneuverOpposingLanes: the unprotected left's R_req) come from a
locate OPPOSING_PROBE_M out along it (opposing_leg; routing/controls.py: opposing_roads), 0 when unknown, and how far out it
stays straight on from our approach (maneuverOpposingStraightM: approach_line; opposing_straight), 0 when unknown.
The opposing road's leg off straight on (maneuverOpposingRelBearing, Maneuver.opposingRelBearing: deg, + right) is that same
road's, the other road nearest straight on (nearest_ahead), sent for the 2026-11-06 rights review's slight-turn cone (a
25-30 deg bend left past a lone side road 40 deg right reads present, and as a TURN would stand the car at a hold line on a
through road). NaN with no opposing road or no junction data, never 0, which is a road dead ahead. Its bearing alone can't
tell that side road from the approach's own road going on off the far side, whose oncoming traffic a slight left off it does
cross (review of 11-06, on the local tiles around the 11-06 drives: of 140 distinct slight lefts on 2500 routes, 66 TURNs on
present alone, the bare cone made keeps of 6; in 4 the far-side road, 26-43 deg right, carried the approach's own name, a
5th, unnamed, its class and speed, those 5 at the approach's own mapped speed, the 6th service roads with none mapped; none
of them the bend). A route that stays on a bending main road comes as 'continue' (11 of the 140), which route_follower's
classify leaves to the model. So route_follower decides nothing on the bearing (2026-11-07, turnpilot/route_follower.py:
slight_far_turn): a slight far-side turn across a present approach is a TURN whatever its bearing, and the bearing rides on
navInstruction (so in the logs) and the maneuver. A road off the far side could be a side road only if shown minor (its mapped speed,
maneuverOpposingSpeed, under the approach's, speedLimit), and no rule takes that yet.
Within a step the route goes straight through intersections without a maneuver; the next one with a lane list is sent
as throughLanes, so a car in a turn-only lane there is flagged.
