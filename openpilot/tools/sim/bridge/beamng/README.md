# BeamNG.tech bridge

openpilot on the Mac drives a car in stock BeamNG.tech on the Windows PC, as a comma four in a Tesla Model 3. The bridge
runs on the Mac and talks to the game over BeamNGpy 1.36 at `192.168.137.1:25252`. It loads `west_coast_usa` with one
ETK 800 (the stock sedan closest to a Model 3: 4.67 m long and 1.39 m tall, against 4.69 m and 1.44 m) and publishes:

- `can` and `pandaStates` for a Model 3 on 3-bit DAS firmware, including `DI_autonomyHealth` (0x054) on bus 0, so card
  fingerprints `TESLA_MODEL_3` with `dashcamOnly` false and alpha longitudinal
- road and wide frames on VisionIPC at 1344x760 with `narrowRoadCameraState` and `wideRoadCameraState` (`sensor` os04c10)
- `accelerometer` and `gyroscope` at 100 Hz, `gpsLocationExternal` at 10 Hz (with a fix, in `frame.py`'s projection),
  and upstream's fake driver monitoring and peripheral state

openpilot's own `DAS_steeringControl` and `DAS_control` come back from `sendcan`, after openpilot's stock Tesla limits,
and drive the game car. The steering angle goes through the Model 3's 12:1 ratio and the ETK 800's 38 degree road-wheel
lock. The acceleration goes through `control.py`, a feedforward plus a PI controller that holds the car's speed on the
integral of the requested acceleration. It doesn't use the game's measured acceleration, which arrives in 100 ms batches
and bounces with the suspension.

The bridge never closes the game. On exit it removes its sensors, brakes the car and disconnects, and the scenario stays
loaded so the next start takes seconds instead of a minute. It does leave the game's global state as it set it (see
[Known limits](#known-limits)) unless you pass `--restore-on-exit`.

## Requirements

- BeamNGpy 1.36 in the repo venv. It isn't in `pyproject.toml`:

  ```sh
  uv pip install --python /Users/kaileh57/Projects/turnpilot/.venv/bin/python beamngpy==1.36
  ```

  `cameras.py` reads camera frames through BeamNGpy's private `connection._pack_data` and `connection.skt`, so keep to
  1.36 or check those two before upgrading.
- An openpilot checkout with the `("pc", "os04c10")` camera config in `common/transformations/camera.py` (turnpilot
  commit 353f4d3), since the bridge publishes os04c10 frames at 1344x760.
- `ffmpeg` on `PATH`, for `--capture` only.

## Run it

Use the repo venv, from the repo root. `OPENPILOT_PREFIX` keeps msgq, params and logs apart from other runs on the Mac.

1. Start openpilot as a comma four in a Model 3:

   ```sh
   OPENPILOT_PREFIX=tpsim openpilot/tools/sim/bridge/beamng/launch_openpilot.sh
   ```

   It is upstream's sim launch with `FINGERPRINT=TESLA_MODEL_3`, alpha longitudinal on, and loggerd kept, so every run
   leaves an rlog in `~/.commatpsim/media/0/realdata`. Add more processes to block with `BLOCK=...`.

2. In a second terminal, start the bridge:

   ```sh
   OPENPILOT_PREFIX=tpsim python -m openpilot.tools.sim.bridge.beamng.run_bridge --engage --rolling-start 20 --set-speed 30
   ```

   `--engage` pulls the cruise stalk as soon as openpilot is engageable. With `--rolling-start`, the bridge first plays
   a driver who presses the gas up to that speed (km/h): the driving model holds a car that stands on an empty road,
   because its standstill acceleration stays under the 0.1 m/s^2 of `drive_helpers.should_stop`.

modeld doesn't reconnect to a new VisionIPC server. Restart openpilot (or at least modeld) whenever you restart the
bridge, or modeld keeps waiting on the old one.

Other options: `--spawn x,y,z --rot qx,qy,qz,qw` (BeamNG world meters; the default is 140 m before the junction
`group_80_81_82_83`, eastbound in the right-hand lane), `--reload`, `--signals` (leave the traffic lights running; by
default every light is forced green and held), `--capture chase.mp4`, `--duration`, `--restore-on-exit`, and
`--camera-update` and `--camera-poll` for the camera timing.

Without a TTY, the bridge reads one command per line on stdin: `cruise_up` (engage, or raise the set speed by 5 km/h),
`cruise_down`, `cruise_cancel`, `blinker_left`, `blinker_right`, `throttle_0.5`, `brake_1`, `steer_-0.2`, `reset` and
`quit`. At the end of stdin (`< /dev/null`, `nohup`, a closed pipe) it keeps running until `quit`, Ctrl-C, SIGTERM or
`--duration`, as with `--no-keyboard`. With a TTY, the keys are upstream's (`tools/sim/README.md`).

## Gate 1

`gate1.py` checks whether one desire pulse makes the driving model take a 90-degree junction. It spawns the car on the
approach to a junction from the road-graph export, engages, and publishes `turnpilotPlan` at 20 Hz with the desire set
for `--pulse-frames` messages once the car is `--leads` meters from the junction. It logs the heading change, the path
and whether the car left on the exit road, to `--out`. Block turnpilotd, the other `turnpilotPlan` publisher:

```sh
BLOCK=turnpilotd OPENPILOT_PREFIX=tpsim openpilot/tools/sim/bridge/beamng/launch_openpilot.sh
OPENPILOT_PREFIX=tpsim python -m openpilot.tools.sim.bridge.beamng.gate1 --junction group_80_81_82_83 --turn left --leads 10,20,30,40
```

`--list` prints the signalized junctions with legal 90-degree turns. The road graph is read from
`~/pc_relay/incoming/osm_export/west_coast_usa_graph.json`.

Gate 1 passed on 2026-10-27 with the big model (`big_driving_tinygrad.pkl`, LFS oid `f0667cf6`, Flip Flop) on the
chestnut, the detector running beside it, 20 camera pairs a second, 25 km/h and a 4-message `turnLeft`/`turnRight` pulse:

| Junction | Turn | Lead | Taken |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `group_80_81_82_83` | left | 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 m | 0/2, 1/2, 2/2, 2/2 |
| `group_80_81_82_83` | right | 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 m | 0/2, 0/2, 2/2, 2/2 |
| `group_46_47_48_49` | left | 40 m | 5/5, heading change 89.0 to 89.8 degrees |
| `group_46_47_48_49` | right | 40 m | 5/5, heading change -89.5 to -91.4 degrees |

At 10 m the car goes straight; at 20 m it turns late and clips the corner. With `--capture` (about 12 pairs a second)
the same right turn at `group_46_47_48_49` was taken once in three runs: run gates at full camera rate.

## Gate 3

`gate3.py` stands the Italy mannequin in the ego's lane `--ped-ahead` m ahead on a junction's approach, engages at
`--speed` and logs at 10 Hz what the driving model (`action.shouldStop`, `desiredAcceleration`, its lead), the detector
(person boxes and confidence by range), the scene (`turnpilotScene` pedestrians, `inPath`) and turnpilotd's plan did, and
the final gap from the camera and from the front bumper. It removes the mannequin after every run. For the model alone,
block turnpilotd and keep `TurnPilotEnabled` set, so modeld still runs the detector and nothing publishes `turnpilotPlan`:

```sh
BLOCK=turnpilotd OPENPILOT_PREFIX=tpsim openpilot/tools/sim/bridge/beamng/launch_openpilot.sh
OPENPILOT_PREFIX=tpsim python -m openpilot.tools.sim.bridge.beamng.gate3 --runs 2 --speed 35 --out gate3.json
```

The road graph's lane centre can be a parking lane away from where the model drives, so once the car drives, gate3
moves the mannequin sideways onto the car's own line at 90 m, beyond the detector's range. Results on 2026-10-27, at
`group_80_81_82_83`, the mannequin 115 m ahead, 35 km/h, two runs each:

- The big model alone never set `shouldStop`. Once it barely braked and drifted 1 m right over the last 30 m, so the
  left front corner clipped the mannequin at 25 km/h; once it braked from 28 m and touched it at about 2.5 km/h. It
  does see a lead there, at the wrong range.
- YOLO26n sees the mannequin as a person from 47 to 60 m on the road camera, confidence 0.5 to 0.85, and loses it
  closer than 5.3 m from the camera.
- With turnpilotd and no route, the scene tracks it in the path from 41 to 55 m and the car stops 3.5 to 3.6 m from the
  camera (2.0 m from the bumper), short of the 5 m target, and holds.

## Routed drives

`route_drive.py` drives a route from `routes.py` with the whole stack: navd routing on Valhalla tiles built from the
road-graph export, turnpilotd, the detector in modeld and turnpilot_web. The bridge plays the driver. It sets each
leg's destination through turnpilot_web's `/api/destination`, as the phone app does, pulls away and engages, and
signals when turnpilotd prompts for a nav lane change (`driver.py`; the Tesla port can't signal). The model stops on
its own at stop signs, and now and then where nothing is in the road, and waits; after 4 s standing without a
TurnPilot hold the driver taps the gas, an override that keeps openpilot engaged, and each tap is logged. The driver
engages again after a disengagement and logs the events behind it, and brakes at the destination. One bridge session runs
`--runs` drives, and `route_stats.py` turns the session's rlogs into per-run stats. Start openpilot with these
params set and nothing extra blocked: `NavigationEnabled`, `TurnPilotEnabled`, `TurnPilotRouteSource=valhalla`
and `TurnPilotValhallaTiles=~/turnpilot_data/valhalla/west_coast_usa`.

```sh
python -m openpilot.tools.sim.bridge.beamng.route_drive --route loop --runs 3 --out loop.json --no-keyboard < /dev/null
python -m openpilot.tools.sim.bridge.beamng.route_stats loop.json   # writes loop_stats.json
```

`--traffic N` spawns N BeamNG traffic cars and removes them at the end, even if the bridge dies. `--capture f.mp4
--capture-fps 5` records the chase view. A loop needs more than one leg, because on this map one leg from a start
back near itself never has more than a few turns.

A full drive stops telling you anything at its first missed turn, since the reroute goes elsewhere. `--screen` runs
one short drive per turn and keep instead (`screen.py`): each starts 130 m before its maneuver in the lane for it,
ends 70 m past it, and stops early once navd says the car is off the route. Use it to find the junctions a route
can't use before you drive the route. A collision while engaged latches `Offroad_ExcessiveActuation` in selfdrived,
and nothing engages again until selfdrived restarts. route_drive stops the session there, and `--start-at N`
resumes the plan on a new stack.

`route_stats.py` reads every route navd published (`navRoute`). A route whose end moved is a new leg, and any other
new route is a reroute. It places the route's turns and keeps from the first `navInstruction` after the route
(`allManeuvers`). A maneuver counts as attempted once the car reaches it along the route, and as taken once the car
is 30 m past it and still on the route. It also counts disengagements with their `onroadEvents`, TurnPilot holds
with their reasons, desire pulses and lane changes.

## Scenario hooks

`scenario.py` works with any BeamNGpy client: in the bridge process use `world.bng` under `world.bng_lock`, from another
script open a second client. It can teleport the ego, read its pose, spawn BeamNG traffic, spawn and move the Italy
mannequin (the only human-shaped stock asset) as a pedestrian prop, remove the traffic again, and force or release
traffic signals. `restore_game` undoes the bridge's global changes, and running the module does that from the shell after
a run that crashed or didn't restore:

```sh
python -m openpilot.tools.sim.bridge.beamng.scenario  # signals running, HUD and particles on, 08:52 light
```

`BeamNGBridge(scenario=...)` runs a callable in the bridge loop at 100 Hz; gate1 is the example.

## Check it without openpilot

```sh
OPENPILOT_PREFIX=tpcheck python -m openpilot.tools.sim.bridge.beamng.check_bridge
```

It starts the bridge and plays the parts of openpilot the bridge talks to: a VisionIPC client, a camera-turn test that
times a frame from the game to VisionIPC, opendbc's Tesla CarState on `can`, the GPS against the game's own position,
and openpilot's Tesla commands on `sendcan`. `check_vipc.py` is the VisionIPC client on its own. Unit tests are in
`tests/`.

## Cameras

Both cameras sit at one mount near the top of the windshield, 1.34 m above the road, level and pointing straight
ahead: the road camera at a 36.82 degree vertical field of view and the wide one at 83.57 degrees, a pinhole stand-in
for the fisheye with the focal length modeld's warp assumes.

The game renders a camera on its frame once the camera's update time has passed. With a 0.02 s update time both cameras
render on every frame. A poll returns the newest render and the game answers it on its main thread, once a frame, so
polling costs frame time: polling each camera every 10 ms on its own connection dropped the game to 9 fps. The bridge
polls both cameras in one pipelined burst on their own connection every 30 ms, which puts both answers on the same game
frame. The publisher sends a pair as soon as both frames are new by hash and its 20 Hz slot is due, converts RGB to NV12
with upstream's `rgb_to_nv12`, and stamps both frames with one time. After 150 ms without a new pair it republishes the
last pair (a standing car can render identical frames), but only while polls succeed: when the cameras go away, frames
stop within a second, the poller reconnects, and after 5 s of failed polls the bridge stops.

The game's frame rate with both cameras sets the ceiling. Rendering both 1344x760 cameras without reading them back
already holds the PC to about 23 fps, and at 896x506 or 672x380 it reaches only about 27 fps, so the cost is per render,
not per pixel or in the transfer. On 2026-10-27 the game ran at 48 to 50 fps idle and 16 to 25 fps with both cameras (a
day earlier: 62 to 77 idle, 23 to 24 with cameras). Measured on 2026-10-27, game on the PC, bridge on the Mac over the
USB4 link:

| What | Value |
| --- | --- |
| With openpilot and modeld (small model on METAL), driving at 25 km/h, 140 s | 17.5 pairs a second at `narrowRoadCameraState` and `modelV2`, median interval 54 ms, p95 104 ms, max 119 ms, 10 s windows 15.1 to 18.8; game at 19.3 fps on average |
| Same, standing still, 90 s | 17.9 a second, 10 s windows 13.7 to 20.0 |
| Bridge alone, standing still, VisionIPC client, game at 20.3 fps | 19.7 a second, none repeated, no frame id gaps, p90 interval 52 ms; the earlier fixed 20 Hz publisher gave 18.0 and 18.8 back to back |
| Road and wide from the same game frame | 17 of 17 camera-turn trials over three runs |
| Frame age, game frame to VisionIPC | 102 to 131 ms, from the camera-turn test |
| Frame age, first sight on the Mac to a VisionIPC client | median 62 to 73 ms |
| RGB to NV12, upstream `rgb_to_nv12` | 3.9 ms a frame on the bench, 4.2 to 4.4 ms in the running bridge |
| Ad-hoc polling, for comparison | 8 to 10.5 pairs a second, 100 to 570 ms old |
| With `--capture` | about 12 pairs a second |

The comma four's cameras run at exactly 20 Hz and modeld steps its temporal context by 50 ms per frame, so at 17.5 Hz the
model sees about 12% less time pass than really does, with occasional 100 ms gaps.

## Known limits

- The camera rate is below 20 Hz whenever the game runs below 20 fps with both cameras, which it did for most of
  2026-10-27 (see [Cameras](#cameras)). Pointing the game's own view at the sky added about 1 fps; it isn't done.
- The game's render pipeline adds about 120 ms between a game frame and its VisionIPC publish, and published timestamps
  are 40 to 50 ms later than the true render time; the comma four's cameras add far less.
- The pose behind the GPS and IMU lags the game by 150 to 210 ms (heading against the game's own, in a 16 to 38 deg/s turn):
  BeamNG ships its 100 Hz IMU readings in batches about every 100 ms, so the 100 Hz IMU messages hold each batch's
  values. The gyro comes from differencing the IMU's world-space axes; the readings' `angVel` doesn't use the documented
  sensor axes (the yaw rate shows up in its third, "right", component).
- The game's IMU has no noise or bias.
- The ETK 800's steering lock (38 degrees) comes from yaw rate at low speed on one street; paramsd learns the rest.
- `--capture` renders a third camera and costs about 8 camera pairs a second.
- modeld doesn't reconnect to a new VisionIPC server: restart it whenever you restart the bridge.
- A teleport resets the car to P; the bridge shifts it back to D, but openpilot raises `wrongGear` in between and
  disengages, as a real Model 3 would.
- The bridge changes global game state on the shared PC and leaves it that way: every traffic signal forced green and
  held, the HUD hidden, particles off, and the time of day held at 13:12. Pass `--restore-on-exit`, or run
  `python -m openpilot.tools.sim.bridge.beamng.scenario` afterwards.
- The World base class allocates two unused 1928x1208 image buffers, and SimulatorBridge an unused Ratekeeper.
