"""Route following: the next maneuver and the distance to it, between navd's 1 Hz updates.

navd publishes navInstruction once a second: maneuverDistance is the distance to the end of the current step,
and it runs down to about -10 m before navd advances to the next step. Between updates the distance is
dead-reckoned from carState.vEgo, which at highway speed is up to 30 m better than the last message.
Maneuver type and modifier are Mapbox/OSRM strings, copied through by navd unchanged.
What counts as a turn: only a junction maneuver, where the route leaves the road at an intersection that other roads
meet (navInstruction.maneuverBranches > 0, from Valhalla's intersection bearings). Where the road just bends and no
other road meets it, the maneuver is NONE: the driving model follows the bend (0.11.3's Autospeed slows for curves), and
TurnPilot sends no desire and no speed cap there. navd moves past such a step only 10 m beyond its end, so the turn or
keep after it (RouteFollower.ahead, from allManeuvers with its junction) is looked ahead to for its speed cap: a junction
turn 30-50 m past a bend was otherwise seen at road speed, too late to slow for, and skipped. Its desire waits until the
car is past the step: a turn desire before a straight-on junction would turn the car there. That is when the step is
dead-reckoned NAVD_ADVANCE_M past, where navd moves on, not up to a second later at navd's next update: the turn after
it becomes the maneuver then, under its own id, which navd's update moving on to it keeps (an update still on the step
only brings the turn's distance). Even so a turn under turn_skip.MIN_FIRST_PULSE_M past the step is skipped out loud.
The angle is the real one, bearing_after less bearing_before. A route
without intersection data (maneuverGeometryValid false; Valhalla always has it) leaves every turn a junction at the
modifier's nominal angle, which is logged once per maneuver and shown in the plan's reason.
A new route (a destination set from the phone, a reroute) can start with a maneuver of the same type and modifier as
the old one, so it is told apart by navd marking it (one invalid navInstruction between the two routes, and a new
routeCount) or by the distance jumping up by more than GPS noise or dead reckoning explain. Either way the old maneuver
was dropped, not passed, and RouteFollower.replaced says so for the one update: its turn pulse must not carry over to the
new route.
Where a junction is: no navd reading of it is trusted over another, however many agree. GPS bias lasts (urban multipath
over a long approach, a fix off while the car stands in a queue, a reroute's snap), and every rule that let readings
outvote each other let a biased track win somewhere and lifted a committed turn's cap short of its junction. So every
reading of the maneuver's junction is dead-reckoned on (JunctionSpan), and what is done with them holds whichever one
is right:
- RouteFollower.distance, and with it the turn's cap, its desire's lead and an unprotected turn's hold line, is the
  NEAREST of them from JunctionSpan.FROM_M in: slow early, never late. A jump up is never taken up for it, so it only ever runs down. Where the
  furthest is more than UNCERTAIN_M beyond it while a committed unprotected turn's hold is ahead, turnpilotd says so out
  loud (controlAlert junctionUncertain) rather than guess, and a hold line read behind where the car can stop at the
  floor stops the car as soon as it can (map_controls.py);
- the maneuver counts as passed (its cap lifted, its id bumped, CLEAR sent) on navd's distance only once the car is
  dead-reckoned PASSED_DIST_M past the FURTHEST of them, never on a vote: of every one since the approach began, however
  far out, since a bias already there as the car comes in FROM_M can last past the commit, its true readings from before
  it the only ones that hold the truth. A reading dead-reckoned that far can only hold the pass later than the rest would
  (and widen the span, saying the junction is uncertain sooner), never earlier. The car having turned it is the other evidence
  (DesireTiming clears it at its angle);
- a curb-side turn's one pulse goes by the furthest (never early), and at the latest by navd's LATEST reading, dead-reckoned
  (JunctionSpan.conf, RouteFollower.junction_latest; desire_timing.pulse_distance): the furthest holds readings from 43-114 m
  out, 8-26 s old, and on 1e's 91 deg right at 8:32 (replayed through one follower for the whole drive) it was still
  8.8 m out with the nearest at the junction, where the latest agreed with the nearest. The latest counts only CONFIRMED:
  a reading within LATEST_AGREE_M of the one before it, dead-reckoned (2026-11-06). Taken alone, one outlier 9 m short about
  20 m out brought the pulse out at 14.8 m (13 m short: 17.1 m), before navd's next true reading, the early turn-in that
  clipped 1e's rights; one 15 m short there had it skipped tooLate 17 m out. On 1d and 1e every latest that brought a right's
  pulse out agreed with the reading before it: 1d 5:02 and 1e 7:15 within 0.4 m, 1e 8:30's jump in from 12.2 m within 4.0 m
  (its next reading 0.1 m off it); no reading inside 45 m of a right jumped in by more than 4.4 m. A reading that doesn't agree
  leaves the last confirmed one, dead-reckoned, so one outlier either way never moves it, and two that agree (a bias that
  lasts) are taken as before;
- a curb-side turn's first pulse is never let go past the junction by the NEAREST reading, one reading alone included, and a
  turn whose nearest crosses its junction unpulsed is skipped out loud there (desire_timing, turn_skip). So one reading 8-10 m
  short 20-45 m out, which the nearest keeps to the end, has the nearest cross the junction before the furthest reaches the
  pulse point, and that right is skipped tooLate 7.7-9.8 m short of its junction with every later reading saying it is ahead
  (HEAD, pulsing at 40 m, took it), its corner cap kept to its pass (turnpilotd keep_hand_cap: 3.0 m/s through it). Kept on
  purpose (2026-11-06 review): the same readings are one TRUE reading inside a long bias of 8-10 m that lasts, and nothing in
  them tells the two apart. Judged by the second-nearest (tried that round, never one reading alone), that right was pulsed
  0.3 m past its junction under an 8 m bias and 2.3 m past under 10 m, nothing said, the late pulse being the dangerous one
  (desire_timing); by the nearest it is skipped tooLate at its junction, out loud, the car held to its cap. A long bias that
  lasts with no true reading in it pulses that late by any reading (the furthest and the latest are as long), and so does one of
  12 m or more with a true reading in it, the next long reading's jump up from inside ADVANCE_NEAR_M taken for navd moving on
  (below): navd's readings alone can't say so. The cap, the hold lines and the pass keep the nearest and the furthest as above.
A committed turn (turnpilotd: its turn desire is out) is never dropped that way (Kellen: never cancel a turn once
committed, and a car slowing for a turn must not speed up into it). The junction is where it was whatever navd says:
- an invalid navInstruction for the same route (navd off the step for a fix, rerouting, the destination removed) or navd
  going quiet past NAV_STALE_S is a gap: the maneuver stays, dead-reckoned, under the same id, until navd's next valid
  update carries on with it or the turn is over (cleared at its angle, or dead-reckoned PASSED_DIST_M past the furthest
  of its readings);
- navd on another step (not same_junction) is a gap too, however close in: navd moving on early to the next step (a
  sharp turn's, up to 10 m before its end, or a GPS jump forward) doesn't mean the car has made the turn. It is over
  only on real evidence: the car has turned it (DesireTiming clears it at its angle) or is dead-reckoned PASSED_DIST_M
  past the furthest of its readings. Until then its id and its cap stay and no CLEAR goes; navd's next update after that takes up the next step;
- a jump in the distance to the same junction, up or down, is GPS noise: one more reading of it (above), however close
  in, and a reroute's readings too. One more than SAME_TURN_M outside its readings so far is navd on another junction (a
  GPS jump, navd moving on early to the next turn the same way on a route without bearings): a gap, as above;
- a new route (a new routeCount) whose first maneuver is the same junction (same_junction) within SAME_TURN_M of the
  dead-reckoned one is the same maneuver (a reroute onto the road the car is on, its origin snapped up to a reroute's
  25 m off), its readings one more of the junction's. A new route that doesn't turn there (a reroute whose origin snapped past
  the junction, a destination changed from the phone) is a gap: the turn is held to its end, and the new route taken up
  after.
After a reroute or a jump navd's distance to the junction can stay off by that much: the turn's cap would lift, or the
turn read as passed, before the car gets there. So from then on that junction is held, while the turn is committed and
after it while navd is still on its step (by its bearings), and never taken up again as a new maneuver.
A curb-side turn is committed only at its one pulse 8 m out (desire_timing, 2026-11-06), where at HEAD its 40 m pulse had
it held from there, so from turn_speed.TURN_CAP_LEAD_M in (its cap's lead) a turn turnpilotd has in hand, acting on it, not
skipped or dropped, its desire not done (update's junction_hold: turnpilotd.turn_in_hand), is held as a committed one is
through an invalid run, navd going quiet past NAV_STALE_S, navd on another step of the same route (moved on early: a route
without bearings moving on 10-14 m short of the first of two rights 50 m apart dropped it 2.9 m short, unpulsed, with nothing
said), a jump past the span's plausible readings, and a jump up from close in beyond every reading of it. But not as a
committed one in two ways, both of which committed=True broke for a turn whose pulse hasn't gone: a new route that doesn't
turn there is taken (its turn dropped, replaced, its cap with it: a gap held to the pass would cap and pulse a right 35 m out
on a dead route), one that does carries its readings over as for any turn (a new id); and its span is never held (_held_id),
so a jump up from inside ADVANCE_NEAR_M that its own readings bear out (within NEW_MANEUVER_JUMP_M of the furthest: the
nearest one short outlier) still re-baselines it as a new maneuver at the same junction, its readings fresh, which the rights
fix relies on for outliers 12-20 m short. Without bearings, two turns the same way closer than SAME_TURN_M read as one
junction: navd moving on early to the second from further out than ADVANCE_NEAR_M is then one more reading of the first,
which no reading can tell from a GPS jump (turnpilotd says a turn in hand the follower drops for another maneuver).
A turn the car has made or is past is never a new maneuver (2026-11-06, drive 1e):
- an invalid navInstruction for the same route (the same routeCount) with the car at or past the maneuver's junction is a gap
  too, committed or not: at 8:36 the right was done (its desire cleared 4 s before, so no longer committed) when navd sent
  one invalid message (off its step for a fix, the car on the exit road), and the valid one after it, the same step at
  -12.1 m, became a new maneuver behind the car, skipped tooLate and announced 'Too Fast to Turn / Rerouting'. Dead-reckoned
  through the gap under the same id, the valid one after it is one more reading of the junction and the turn is passed at
  PASSED_DIST_M; NAV_STALE_S still ends a real loss, and a new route (its separator carries the new routeCount) still resets.
  Only a TURN's or a KEEP's, the maneuvers the car makes: past a bend step (NONE) or at the arrival the invalid message is a
  drop as before, since dead-reckoned on through a route cancelled just past a bend the follower would move on to the turn
  after it (_move_on) and cap and pulse it for a route that no longer exists;
- a new maneuver whose first reading is already behind the car (a reroute that arrived stale: at 9:43 a fresh route's first
  step was 4.8 m behind) is passed from the start (upcoming None: no pulse, no skip, no skip mark for navd), logged
  (turnpilot.maneuver_behind); navd moves on from it as the car drives. Behind by its own reading and by the furthest of its
  span: a reroute's same junction carries the old span over, and one short outlier the nearest kept below zero must not pass
  that turn, uncommitted (a right is until its 8 m pulse), with no pulse, skip or word at all.
A slight turn across oncoming traffic is a turn, not a keep (make_maneuver; 1e seg 5 and 1d seg 9: slight lefts of 29 and
38 deg with an oncoming approach were keeps, refused at night for no lane line (keepNoLine), driven straight, 'Fork Missed'
and rerouted into a left; a keepLeft there would have crossed the oncoming lanes with no hold and no gap check): a
"slight" turn (not a fork or ramp) at a junction whose bearings turn SLIGHT_TURN_MIN_DEG or more to the far side, with an
opposing approach present, is a TURN, so an autonomous unprotected left (unprotected_left.py: driven to its hold line, then
a gap the camera sees or a loud handback). True forks under that angle, slight turns to the curb side, ramps, and slight
turns with no opposing approach (or one not known) stay keeps.
navd's "present" is any other road within 45 deg of straight on (routing/guidance.py: OPPOSING_DEG), one 26-45 deg off the
far side included, and that road's bearing decides nothing (2026-11-07). The 11-06 rights review had a cone on it (a road
further than 25 deg off the other side taken for a side road past a main road bending left, the slight turn left a keep, so
as not to hold the car at a line on a through road); with navd sending the bearing (maneuverOpposingRelBearing, + right of
straight on, NaN unknown; Maneuver.opposing_rel_deg, None unknown), on the local tiles around the 11-06 drives (2500 routes:
140 distinct slight lefts, 66 TURNs on present alone) the cone made keeps of 6, and none was that bend: in 5 the far-side
road was the approach's own road going on (4 carrying its name, a 5th its class and speed, each at the approach's own mapped
speed), whose oncoming lanes the left crosses, as a keep with no hold line and no gap check; the 6th service roads with no
speed mapped. A route that stays on a bending main road comes as 'continue' (11 of the 140), which classify leaves to the
model (NONE) before any of this, and at an end of road there is no road of the car's own to keep along. So a slight far-side
turn across a present approach is a TURN whatever that road's bearing: a hold too many, never one too few (routing/guidance.py's
rule for opposing). The bearing stays on navd's message (so in the logs) and on the maneuver, for a minor-road rule (that
road's mapped speed, maneuverOpposingSpeed, under the approach's) should a keep there ever be shown safe.
