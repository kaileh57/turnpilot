"""The unprotected left's carry across the oncoming lanes (turnpilotd.left_carry, go_override's carry, unprotected_left's
LeftDecision.carry) in closed loop: the Sim's car, turnpilotd and the real longitudinal planner (plannerd's lift).

Review 2026-11-08, round 2's trade ('G5's coast'): a slow launch the left judged on keeps driving unless a car is seen in the
band its launch needs, so a model that only keeps the speed plannerd's lift gave it (0.78 m/s), nothing in the camera's
band, crossed the oncoming lanes at that speed for about 15 s, where the gap rule's R_req assumed the left's own launch
(A_GO to V_GO: under 3 s in them). A car outside the camera's band at the go could arrive while it was still in them. Now a
left committed (it can no longer stop short of them) short of a launch after such a judgement is carried across at the
left's post-go profile: plannerd lifts the model's candidate to the profile's accel cap and speed, never more, never
steering, every rail of the lift's kept."""
