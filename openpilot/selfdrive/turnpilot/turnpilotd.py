"""turnpilotd: turns the active route and the scene into desire pulses, lane-change requests and longitudinal limits.

modeld takes the plan's desire and lane change, plannerd its accel and speed caps (see hooks.py). The lane paint the
detector reads comes in with its detections, and is used only while those are fresh (the scene is available); none read
is unknown paint, and no lane change. The lane planner plans lane changes only with TurnPilotLanePaintActive set; without
it a second planner publishes what it would have asked for in laneChangePaintRule, so drives can be scored. In shadow mode
(TurnPilotShadowMode) everything is computed and published with shadow=True, and nothing acts on it.
It runs onroad only while TurnPilotEnabled. The manager doesn't restart a process that died, and a dead one
soft-disables openpilot for the rest of the drive (processNotRunning), so an exception in the plan or the scene is
logged and a disabled plan or an empty scene goes out instead.

TurnPilot acts only while it can do its job (Kellen, 2026-10-27: no degraded mode, and every failure loud):
- Not until the detector's first fresh results after TurnPilot is turned on (state unavailable, "waiting for the
  detector"): modeld loads it only while disengaged, so a mid-drive enable can't be handed back before it ever ran.
  A detector with no results DETECTOR_START_DEADLINE_S of modelV2 frames after that (no pkl, a failed load, none for the
  driving model) never started: handback noDetector. modeld publishes no modelV2 while it loads the detector, so the
  load itself doesn't count against it. Nor do frames with openpilot engaged (carControl.enabled) before modeld had
  its chance to load it, LOAD_CHANCE_S disengaged with TurnPilot on: turned on and engaged within modeld's param check,
  it waits for a disengage, and TurnPilot waits with it. Never silently, though: DETECTOR_START_DEADLINE_S from the
  first engaged frame with no detection yet (whatever modeld publishes, engaged or not since), it is noDetector too. A
  load that failed while the driver engaged during it (modeld publishes nothing while it loads) is handed back so.
- Once it has run, DETECTOR_DEADLINE_S without fresh results is a stopped detector. modeld's own skips stay inside it: a
  slow spell forces a run after 1 s, a failed run retries after 1 s. A second forced wait (2 s) or failure in a row is
  past it.
- A modelV2 from the small model after one from the big model is a fallback (modelV2.big), for the rest of the drive.
  So is modeld's ChestnutActive False (read in main()): it outlives this process, which TurnPilot turned off and on
  restarts, and covers a big model that failed to load.
On either, plan.handback is set and selfdrived soft-disables (handback.py). TurnPilot stops at once: no new desire,
lane change, signal prompt, skipped-turn reroute or wrong-lane flag, and the maneuver in hand is dropped. A turn whose
desire already went out is never cancelled (desire_timing.py): its desire is held, with no new pulse, and cleared from
the model at the turn's angle as usual; a keep desire is dropped. On a fallback the destination is removed, which
cancels navd's route, once such a turn is over. The scene's stops in force stay, and so does the turn speed cap of a turn
whose desire already went out: a handback must not speed the car up. Nor does the route going away under a committed
turn cancel it (route_follower.py: gaps, navd going quiet, reroutes are dead-reckoned through). Nor does a cap the car
was slowing for going away with the maneuver or the route: from the handback until openpilot stops steering (the soft
disable's end) the speed cap holds the car at no more than its speed then, and at no more than it has slowed to since
(hold_v), or than the driver's gas has taken it to.
A fault (plan()) is a disabled plan; it carries the handback, so a fault never hides one, and the detector's deadlines
and the scene's stops in force run on through it (only turning TurnPilot off resets them). So does a committed turn:
its route and desire state are kept (its desire, dropped by the disabled plan, pulses again only as on re-engaging), and
the car is held to its speed while faulted (hold_v), as on a handback. A faulted plan carries the
scene's limits (live pedestrians, or those carried through a detector gap, and the junction hold in force where it
was; scene_policy.py), which plannerd acts on (hooks.limits_plan), so a turnpilotd failing every frame still never
drives the car on through a pedestrian. Its desire and lane change are never acted on.
Once the detector is back and TurnPilot acts again, the dropped maneuver is taken up or skipped out loud, never left
half driven (_take_up_dropped).
A handback or a fault cancels a lane change that is offered and not yet started, with laneChangeAbort handedBack or
fault for ABORT_HOLD_S (selfdrived raises turnpilotLaneChangeAborted); TurnPilot turned off cancels it as turnedOff.
A change DesireHelper has started goes on, and one it may have started on the request already isn't announced as
aborted (lane_planner.LanePlanner._abort).
Alert priority (hooks.plan_events): handback, then fault (turnpilotUnavailable), then too fast to turn, then a lane
change, then wrong lane. While TurnPilot isn't acting or is faulted, too fast to turn, wrong lane and lane change offers
are never set here; the rest of the order is selfdrived's (hooks.plan_events, hooks.lane_change_events).
