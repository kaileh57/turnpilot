"""The stop sweep at every stop and yield, and step S3's evidence (STOP_SIGNS.md 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 4.3; SG3b). Nothing here acts.

turnpilotd asks modeld for the held cycle (turnpilotPlan.detectorView stopSweep: full wide, side left, road, side right) for
every stop or yield control map_controls has engaged (sweep_control), from STOP_SWEEP_M before it until the car is
SWEEP_PAST_M past it, whether openpilot is engaged or not: step S3's dwell is driven with it off and TurnPilot on, and
modeld reads the field through fresh_plan, so a shadow drive sweeps too. It asks only with the car at walking pace
(sweep_wanted: at or under SWEEP_V_MAX, held to SWEEP_V_OFF): at road speed the held cycle would halve the road camera's
rate and slow scene_policy's hard-brake confirmation, so the approach keeps modeld's own choice. The unprotected left's own
view (the road camera from its go to its commit, CRITIQUE REQUIRED 3; roadAndWide held at its line) outranks it
(detector_view): the sweep suspends the far crop the left reads. SG4a's decider takes the field over with its own cycles.

Over the swept control's whole window, at any speed, JunctionWatch keeps its live visibility (visibility.py) and track
evidence (stop_evidence.py), fed every run turnpilotd drains, and logs:

- turnpilot.stop_visibility every VIS_LOG_S: each conflicting lane's reach, R_seen, need, binding limit, blockers and shields,
  the views' freshness and the lane-edge estimate (read by nothing).
- turnpilot.junction_evidence once per control, when its sweep ends (passed, dropped, another control, TurnPilot off): the
  junction (OSM node, our arriving heading approachBearingDeg, the stop point, its conflicting lanes and their needs), the
  camera setback and whether step S1
  measured it, how long the car stood at the stop point, and per cross track its class, lane (role, index), view, first-track
  range (the pessimistic distance end), its lane's need, whether it was moving toward our path when its speed was first
  trusted, its longest gap between matches inside that need, whether it stopped at its line or went through at speed, how
  long our car had been standing at the stop point when it was first tracked (settledS, -1 if it wasn't), and the lighting
  row then. openpilot/tools/turnpilot/junction_validate.py reads these from the rlogs (section 4.3).

The lanes are every conflicting lane of the junction for any maneuver (the union: a stamp is per approach, not per
maneuver), seen from the control's stop point; the lighting row is the sun's at the junction from the wall clock, only while
the system time is valid ('unknown' otherwise, which validates nothing).
