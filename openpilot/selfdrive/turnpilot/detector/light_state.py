"""Traffic light state from the detector's class-9 boxes, read on the CPU copy of the road camera's full-resolution frame
(DESIGN phase 4 G2). What it reads is published and logged; under TurnPilotCameraLights addOnly (the default since
2026-11-06, LIGHT_MODE_DEFAULT) a governing red adds a stop at its signal (map_controls), under shadow nothing acts on it.

A box is gated before any colour is read, so that tail and brake lights, red signs and glare low in the frame never
become a red (CRITIQUE REQUIRED 8):
- small: its long side under HEAD_MIN_H_PX full-frame px. Below that a lamp is under about 8 px and a ball can't be told from
  an arrow, so it is never read (a 1.07 m head at about 50 m on a comma four).
- belowHorizon: its bottom edge is less than MIN_ELEVATION_DEG above the calibrated horizon. A signal head hangs 4-6 m
  over the road, above the camera; a car's lights are below it.
Gated boxes are counted, never published (modeld logs the counts once a minute: LightReader.take_counts). A box past the
gates is a head, and its state is read (its reason the published Light.reason: read or one of these):
- aspect: not a vertical head (height/width outside MIN_ASPECT-MAX_ASPECT): horizontal, a doghouse, a pedestrian signal.
  Unknown.
- A lamp pixel is bright (HSV value) and either saturated in a lamp hue or blown out white. dark: no third of the box
  holds LIT_FRAC_MIN of them. Unknown.
- The lit lamp is a run of lit rows (lamp_runs: rows holding ROW_REL of the fullest row's lamp pixels, gaps of GAP_REL
  closed), the run with the most; its third is the one its core's centre (its pixels at CORE_REL of its brightest) lies in,
  its colour and shape read on its rows grown through the rows next to them that hold any lamp pixel. twoLit: a second,
  separate run with SECOND_LIT_REL of its pixels (and LIT_FRAC_MIN of a third's). streak: the run's core (first to last
  row) is taller than STREAK_MAX of the run's widest row, or the run than RUN_MAX_REL of the box: a lit pole, a sign filling
  the box, glare, never a lamp (a lamp's glow trailing below its face is the lamp's: STREAK_MAX; a round red or green glow
  that fills its box is a lamp boxed by its glow: ROUND_MAX). Unknown either way.
  Until 2026-11-07 the lit third was the third holding the most lamp pixels and any other third with half its share was
  twoLit, and a lamp's glow made it two. On the 11-06 night drives 667 head reads gave no green and no
  colour on any head governing the car's lane (heads 36-86 px tall: not small; 32 reds, all on side heads 15-30 deg off
  the lane, off the lamps' beam and so dimmer, it seems: there are no frames). The one governing head a frame shows (1d
  4:05, standing 31 m from it, box 24x46 px, no colour in 84 reads over 48 s; the qlog thumbnail, a quarter the size):
  the red lamp's face blown pink-white (S 0.15-0.29, no hue) with a saturated red glow (V 150-200, S 0.5-0.9) spreading
  below it under the visor, so the lamp straddles the top and middle thirds and the old read said twoLit (0.43 and 0.47
  of the thirds lit, the thumbnail upscaled); its core's centre is at 0.28 of the box: red. Read through its glow (the
  run), one lamp is one lamp. On the comma demo route's 878 daylight head reads (2026-11-07 replay) it
  changed no colour read and read 45 more, every one the colour its crop shows (green and yellow balls the sky had made
  arrows or two lamps, greens on a third's edge); voted (the lane taken straight), 36 more road runs had a governing green
  and 1 a yellow, the reds the same 371.
- noColor: the lit lamp's saturated pixels don't agree on red, yellow or green. Unknown. HUES green ends at 195 deg: on the
  demo route the green lamps' pixels lie at 166-181 (1-99%) and the sky's at 195-216, which up to 210 counted as a green
  lamp (a box over a head with sky in its bottom third read green; sky beside a green ball called it an arrow). The night
  green lamp's glow (1d 5:05 thumbnail) is 159-168.
- positionMismatch: a yellow whose lit lamp isn't in the box's middle third (YELLOW_SPAN). Unknown. Only a yellow: its hue
  is a streetlight's and an amber sign's too. A red's and a green's colour is the hue's alone, wherever the lamp sits: at
  night the box is drawn round the lamp's glow, the housing as dark as the sky, and the lamp sits anywhere in it.
- arrow: the lit lamp's pixels aren't mirror-symmetric left to right about their own centre, as a ball is and a turn
  arrow is not. A green arrow is unknown: it is never a permission. A yellow arrow is unknown too: a flashing yellow
  arrow is a permissive left, and blocking on it would stall the autonomous left in the phase it is built for. A red
  arrow keeps its colour (reason arrow): it never permits a go, so the autonomous left's go (map_controls.turn_light)
  and every lift (release_light) at its junction see it as a red; a green ball beside a red left arrow is not a left's
  green. Under add-only (the default) a camera red adds a stop at its signal, so a red arrow alone over the car's lane
  stops it there too, as a red: a stop and a loud handback, never a run. This is a proxy at these
  sizes: on the comma demo route it caught 24-78% of two red left arrows' reads, and called 10 reads of a red ball, 30
  of a yellow ball and 25 of a green ball arrows, so a red arrow must never turn unknown on it alone (the sky in the
  lamp's third made most of the green and yellow balls' arrows: since 2026-11-07 15 of the green and 2 of the yellow
  reads there read their colour).
Under LIGHT_READ_CONF, down to decoder.LIGHT_GREEN_CONF, a box within the governing bearing is read too (GREEN_LOW_MAX a
frame) and is a head only on a run it reads green: at night the detector boxes a lit green lamp less surely than a red one,
and a green can only let a stop go. A red or yellow there is never a head.
The reader reads boxes down to decoder.LIGHT_READ_CONF, under the detector's MIN_CONF (route 29, 2026-11-08: a red read only
at its line, its heads first boxed at MIN_CONF 40 m out and then not for 1.7 s; the full pass had them at 0.2-0.33 from about
60 m), and a head from a box under MIN_CONF is published only once it reads a colour or holds a vote. Every box it
considered and did not publish (the gated ones with their gate, the ones under MIN_CONF that read no colour with their
reason and detail) is kept from the last read (LightReader.rejects) and logged by modeld on that run's message
(TurnpilotDetections.lightRejects), which nothing reads back: with the heads, an rlog alone shows every class-9 box down to
decoder.LIGHT_GREEN_CONF, its confidence and why it is no head.
A head's state is its vote: the colour most of its last VOTE_M sightings read, none older than VOTE_S, once VOTE_N did
(counted in sightings and seconds, never in runs: the same vote at any run rate), which also rides out LED flicker. A head
governs the car's lane when its bearing lies within GOVERN_BEARING_DEG of the lane's (the
driving model's path at the head's distance), and the governing state is what all governing heads with a state agree
on, else unknown.

Distance is to the head, from its elevation and an assumed height: the stop line is not known from the camera.

What tunes it next (2026-11-07): each read carries a detail (HeadRead.detail: the thirds' lamp shares, the lit run, its
core's centre and rows, its pixels and widest row, its peak value, the saturated pixels per colour), published with the head
(LightHead.detail), and every SAMPLE_S the reader logs a sample (turnpilot.light_sample, debug level, so the rlog alone):
up to SAMPLE_HEADS heads, the governing first, each with its detail and its box's NV12 crop at full resolution (rows over
SAMPLE_MAX_PX subsampled). The 11-06 drives left no frames: the next night's rlog has the lamps themselves.
