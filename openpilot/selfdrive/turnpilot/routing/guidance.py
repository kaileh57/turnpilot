"""The lanes and the upcoming maneuvers for navInstruction, read from Mapbox-shaped route steps.

Mapbox and Valhalla (format=osrm) both put the lanes of a maneuver in two places: the sub banner of the step
before it, and the first intersection of the step that starts with it. Valhalla only adds the sub banner for
the last 400 m of the step, while the intersection has the lanes all along, so the banner comes first (it is
what Mapbox shows) and the intersection fills in the rest. A lane is active if it can be used for the maneuver,
and activeDirection is the direction it takes from there.

The junction of the maneuver is the first intersection of the step that starts with it, as Valhalla gives it
(format=osrm): the bearings of every road there, which one the route comes in by ('in') and leaves by ('out'), and
the maneuver's bearing_before and bearing_after. TurnPilot takes a maneuver as a junction turn only where some other
road meets it (turnpilot/route_follower.py), and its angle from the two bearings.
Within a step the route goes straight through intersections without a maneuver; the next one with a lane list is sent
as throughLanes, so a car in a turn-only lane there is flagged.
