  TurnPilot's alerts share one slot, at most one of them a frame, by this priority:
  1. a handback (turnpilotDetectorStopped, turnpilotNoDetector, turnpilotModelFellBack; handback.py): nothing here while one is set;
  2. a fault (turnpilotUnavailable);
  3. a hard brake for a confirmed pedestrian or oncoming vehicle (turnpilotControlAlert, hardBrake), or the stop-sign
     decider's in-path rail for a confirmed vehicle in the car's path past the commit point (carCrossing), then a handback
     with the car held (turnpilotControlPrompt, TAKE_CONTROL_PROMPTS: a stop sign, an unprotected turn, the car stopped
     or stalled in a turn, or not pulling away after TurnPilot's go), then a map stop it can't make gently (turnpilotControlAlert, cannotStopComfortably: take
     control), or off the route with the map stops ahead unknown (offRouteStopsUnknown: the speed capped, take control
     or wait for the reroute), or an unprotected left's go withdrawn for oncoming traffic (oncomingHolding);
  4. too fast to turn, or a turn from a standstill missed (turnpilotTooFastToTurn, turnMissed), or navd's reroute past a keep
     the model drove under TurnPilotAlwaysDrive (KEEP_REROUTED);
  4b. over a wait's silent prompt (WAIT_PROMPTS: the left waiting or creeping, the decider waiting for cross traffic, a yield),
     a said-once line in its onset (ONSET_OVER_WAITS: the light reader failing, the far crop or the side views lost), its
     chime with it: those waits last as long as the car stands (review 2026-11-07, SF-2, SF-3);
  5. a map control's other prompt (turnpilotControlPrompt: yield ahead, an unprotected left waiting for a gap or creeping for
     a view, visual only; its go, a short chime);
  6. a map control's other alerts (turnpilotControlAlert: a stop line overrun, going on a yellow, an unprotected turn's
     junction uncertain, the car stopped with nothing holding it: the stopped note's chime);
  7. a planned lane change, offered or just aborted (turnpilotLaneChangeLeft/Right/Aborted, LaneChangeEvents);
  7b. the prompt to signal the turn (turnSignal.prompt: CarSignalEvents raises its line): nothing below while it is up (SF-1);
  8. the wrong lane for the turn ahead (turnpilotWrongLane), then the lights unknown (turnpilotControlAlert,
     LIGHTS_UNKNOWN_ALERTS: the camera's light reader failing, up for its whole spell), then a lane it can't confirm
     (turnpilotWrongLane);
  9. a keep the model drives under TurnPilotAlwaysDrive (turnpilotTooFastToTurn, KEEP_FOLLOW: a status line), then the map
     controls' other status (turnpilotControlAlert: map stops unavailable, a view off).
  The alerts of 4 to 9 are all Priority.LOW or lower, where AlertManager shows the newest, so the order is kept by not
  raising the lower ones: the wrong lane isn't raised while a lane change is offered or its abort holds (the car is in a
  turn-only lane at an intersection before the turn the change is for), and lane_change_events raises nothing while the
  plan is too fast to turn, faulted or has a map control's prompt or alert up (the skip drops the maneuver, so its offer
  aborts that same frame, and the skip says why).
  turnpilotd keeps the lower ones unset while it isn't acting or is faulted (turnpilotd.py). A handback cancels an
  offered lane change with its abort (turnpilotLaneChangeAborted, reason handedBack), raised with it: on screen the
  engaged handback's soft disable (Priority.MID) outranks it, and while disengaged the abort (a WARNING) isn't shown.
  A fault is a WARNING with a chime while engaged, held TURNPILOT_FAULT_ALERT_S so a one-frame fault is heard and read
  (selfdrived/events.py), and PERMANENT at Priority.LOWER while not."""
