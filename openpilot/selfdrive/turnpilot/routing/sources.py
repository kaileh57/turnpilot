"""Where navd's route comes from: Valhalla on a corridor of tiles from TurnPilot's map server, or on local tiles.

There is no Mapbox and no fallback. Before routing, the car and the destination are checked against the cached
coverage; then the corridor for the drive is downloaded, verified and unpacked, and every route and reroute for that
destination runs locally on it. Any failure is a MapError, reported in TurnPilotMapStatus, and navd has no route.

TurnPilotValhallaTiles is the developer and sim override (BeamNG sets it): when set, its tiles are used as they are,
with no geofence and no download.
