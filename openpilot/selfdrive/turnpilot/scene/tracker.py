"""Tracks YOLO26 detections over time and ranges them: turnpilotDetections in, TurnpilotScene objects out.

A minimal ByteTrack-style tracker (the idea from github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack, MIT; this is our own code): high-confidence
detections match tracks by box IoU first, the rest get a second, stricter IoU pass, and only high-confidence leftovers
start tracks. Two TurnPilot additions: detections alternate between the road and wide cameras, whose boxes can't be
compared, so a third pass matches what's left by ground position; and a constant-velocity Kalman filter on ground
position, with the car's own motion taken out in the predict step, so velocities are over the ground, not relative.
Every run's boxes also come out as they are (raw, raw_new: RawFrame), tracked or not, with their bearing and ground range
uncapped, for the unprotected left's gap rule: a distant car that never scores NEW_TRACK_CONF never becomes a track, so
track absence certifies nothing (CRITIQUE REQUIRED 2). A run before calibration (calStatus not calibrated) is no run at all:
nothing it carried can be ranged or borne, so it never reads as an empty, clear one (skeptic G4). The scene goes unavailable
then, as for a detector gone quiet, so turnpilotd tells the two apart by the same test (is_calibrated): calibrating holds
its detector deadlines and says so, never "detector not running".

The far crop's runs (DESIGN phase 4 G5: turnpilotFarDetections, update_far) come out the same way (raw_far, raw_far_new),
view far: their boxes are in the road camera's full-frame pixels, so they range and bear with the road lens, and the run
says which bearings it covered at the horizon (cover_deg). A far box matching a track by its box tags it (view far,
farHits) and does nothing else: it never starts a track, never counts as a hit (TrackedObject.age, which a hard stop's
confirmation reads: scene_policy), never moves the filter, never keeps a track alive, never makes the scene fresh. So the
full pass alone feeds every stop, as before the far crop.
Tracker B (scene/tracker_b.py, TurnPilotFarPeds) is a second SceneTracker that also takes the far crop's people and two-wheelers
through update_tiles: they start and extend its tracks, and nothing of freshness is theirs. Only its pedestrians no tracker A
pedestrian holds reach the scene policy, as objects that can never confirm (scene_policy.B_ID); tracker A, turnpilotScene and
everything that reads them are as above.

The stop sweep's runs (STOP_SIGNS.md 1.3, SG3b) say their view too: a side view's boxes (sideLeft, sideRight) are in the wide
camera's fisheye pixels, so they range, bear and match as the wide camera's. The latest RawFrame of each view is kept in
raw_by_view (view_key: road, full, sideLeft, sideRight, far), a track says the view and camera time of its last match
(TrackedObject.view, tSeen), and turnpilotd hands every run it drains to update_runs, which takes them in camera-time
order. A track coasts MAX_COAST_S after its last match, SWEEP_COAST_S while a stop sweep runs (coast_s, set by turnpilotd):
two missed passes of a 5 Hz view.
