"""The OSM stop-sign sidecar: every stop sign, yield and level crossing in a region's OSM data, by the approach it
governs, sharded on Valhalla's level-2 grid so a corridor carries the shards for its own tiles.

  osm_controls.py <region.osm.pbf | export.osm> <out_dir> --timestamp T --tiles DIR

Valhalla sets no stop_sign flag on about a quarter of the OSM-mapped stop approaches (research_allway.md section 0), drops
stop=all, and puts a phantom stop at the far end of a stop it can't direct. navd's routing/controls.py unions these shards
with Valhalla's flags (STOP_SIGNS.md, SG1a). Written by build_region.py right after build_valhalla_tiles.sh, from the same
PBF, so the way ids match the tiles; build_sim_tiles.sh runs it on the sim level's export.

Writes <out_dir>/osm_controls/<level-2 tile index>.json for EVERY level-2 tile under --tiles (empty or not), so on the car
a missing shard is never mistaken for a tile with no stops. Each shard:
  {"version", "osm_timestamp" (the tiles' own stamp: the car refuses, out loud, a shard whose stamp differs), "tile",
   "controls": {"<way_id>:<f|b>": [{kind stop|yield, line [lat, lon] or null, junction_node (0: none), stop_tag
                                    all|minor|none, evidence, node (the sign's OSM node)}, ...]},
   "junctions": {"<osm node id>": {pos [lat, lon], approaches [{way_id, dir f|b, bearing_deg, class, maxspeed, oneway,
                                   stops, kind, evidence, line}, ...]}},
   "rail": [{lat, lon, ways [way_id, ...]}],
   "unplaced": [{node, kind, lat, lon, direction, stop_tag, why}],
   "signals": [{node, kind signal|crossing, lat, lon, ways [way_id, ...], direction f|b|''}]}
"signals" (the signal layer, build_signals) is every node where signal heads can stand: highway=traffic_signals (kind
signal), and a crossing with signals (crossing=traffic_signals, crossing:signals=yes, or a signalled crossing_ref: kind
crossing); ways the drivable ways it is on (none: mapped beside the road); direction the traffic its heads face, along (f)
or against (b) its ways' node order, from direction= or traffic_signals:direction= forward|backward; '' when untagged, both,
or on ways that are not one road through it (a junction; two ways meeting end to end or start to start). The key is new
beside the others: a car before it ignores it, and a shard without it says the layer is unknown there (osm_sidecar.py).
f: traffic travelling along the way's node order (Valhalla's edge.forward), b: against it. A control sits in the shard of
its line (of its junction when it has no line), a junction, a crossing and an unplaced sign in the shard of their
position. Every stop and give_way node is in a shard once, as a control or unplaced, so route_audit can list one near a
route that no control placed.

The junction model (from stopsigns/scripts/allway_osm.py):
- drivable ways: DRIVABLE highway classes, not area=yes, not closed to motor vehicles. A junction is a node with at least
  3 drivable legs (2 where a way passes through, 1 where it ends). An approach is (way, f) arriving along the way's order
  or (way, b) against it; a oneway gives only its legal arrival.
- a stop or give_way on a junction node applies to every approach (evidence node_all with stop=all, node_untagged
  without), or with stop=minor only to the approaches of a lower class than the junction's top one (node_minor, as
  Valhalla does); it has no line (null): the node is the junction's middle, not where anyone stops.
- anywhere else (mid-way, or on a node shared only with a footway or a way's continuation) it governs the first junction
  within MAXD m along its way, the walk carrying on across a way split (a 2-leg node where the way ends and one other
  drivable way starts or ends) onto the way carrying on, CARRY_ON_PASSES splits at most: direction=forward the one ahead
  along the way (mid_directed), backward the one behind, both each of them (mid_both), and with no or another direction
  the nearest (mid_undirected, by proximity). Its node is the line, and it is keyed to the way its traffic arrives at it
  on (the way ending there when the sign is on a split). A stop with no junction within MAXD still stops its approach:
  it is kept with junction_node 0 (each direction its way allows when undirected) and counted (no_junction_within_maxd).
- a sign no approach takes is unplaced, with why: not_on_a_drivable_way (mapped beside the road, on a footway), or
  no_lower_approach (stop=minor on a junction whose approaches are all of its top class).
- an approach's bearing_deg is the bearing of the leg leaving the junction (deg from north, as Valhalla's begin_heading),
  over BEARING_M of it; maxspeed is m/s from the way's maxspeed tag ("25 mph", "40", "40 km/h"), null when untagged or
  unreadable; stops/kind/evidence/line the control on that approach, if any (a mid-way line before a node's).

Needs osmium-tool on the build machine. The PBF pass takes about a minute for the Indianapolis region on the Mac.
