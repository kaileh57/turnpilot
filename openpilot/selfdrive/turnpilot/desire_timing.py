"""Desire timing: which desire to send the driving model for the next maneuver, and when.

modeld feeds the model only the rising edge of a desire, so the desire is held through the maneuver and the
lead distance is the timing lever. Gate 1 (big model, 25 km/h, 2026-10-27) took 90-degree turns from a pulse
40 m before the junction and not from 10-20 m; a keep desire goes within max(2.5 s * v, 20 m). Once a desire
starts it is latched until the maneuver is passed (a keep: or the timeout; a turn is over only when the car has turned it
or is past it, never on a clock: a slow approach in a queue to a hold took longer, and the go then had no turn to pulse,
silently): navd's 1 Hz distance carries a few meters of noise, and dropping the desire whenever it read past the lead
again sent the model a new rising edge each time.
A keep toward a side where the model sees no lane line drove the car off the road there, so it is dropped.
The model forgets a pulse 132 frames after it (6.6 s at 20 Hz, its desire history; see below): where the slow
approach took longer than that, it planned the turn and then dropped it 10 m out, and a late retry pulse brought
the turn back at once. So a turn desire is pulsed again every REPULSE_S on the approach, and once more ENTRY_M
before the junction, so the last pulse is fresh for the whole turn: at 4 m/s a turn outlasts one pulse, and the
model let go of it halfway round. None once the car has turned TURN_STARTED_DEG (by its yaw rate): pulses during
the turn turned the car on past the exit road, into the curb. That holds for a repeat and one on engaging. One as the car
pulls away after a standstill (STANDSTILL_REARM_S) goes while it has turned less than STANDSTILL_REPULSE_MAX_DEG: waiting
in the junction for oncoming traffic, 15-25 degrees into a left, longer than the model's queue, the turn would lapse
(H2, below: with the pulse gone at 5-16 degrees the model gave up 3 turns of 3); further round (stopped halfway for a
pedestrian) none goes, and the model finishes it (H2: 9 of 10 from 25-42 degrees). While a hold has the car standing
(turnpilotd: shouldStop) the turn desire is none, its edge still in the model's queue, so the pulse on the hold's go is
a fresh edge in the very plan that lets the car go (BeamNG unprotected_left_visible: let go a frame or more before its
pulse, the car drove straight across the junction).
A repeat pulse is a short drop to none, long enough that modeld (unsynchronized, conflated subscriber) can't miss it.
The model keeps the rising edges of the last 132 frames (6.6 s at 20 Hz, the big model's state_desire_q), and
forgets a pulse when it leaves that queue. A pulse still in the queue once the car is round the corner turns it
on: at a 55 degree "left" the car turned 122-126 degrees into the curb, the last pulse 6.6 s from leaving.
So once the turn is done, CLEAR_DESIRE goes out and modeld drops the turn desires from the queue: at the
junction (navd past it) once the car has turned CLEAR_MIN_DEG, or anywhere within CLEAR_MARGIN_DEG of the turn's
angle (80 degrees for a 90 degree left or right), but not before CLEAR_MIN_FRACTION of it (a 40 degree left at 30).
The angle is the junction's real one from Valhalla's bearings (route_follower.py), else the modifier's nominal one.
Short of CLEAR_MIN_DEG it waits: in H2's single-pulse runs, with the pulse gone at 5-16 degrees the model gave up
3 turns of 3, and at 25-42 degrees it finished 9 of 10 on its own (the one it gave up was at 32).
No turn pulse starts while the car is too fast to make the turn (turn_skip.py, may_start false): the turn speed cap
has the car at 6.9 m/s by the lead, and faster than the check allows something else holds the speed (the driver's
foot), so the model would turn from road speed. Too fast for long, the turn is skipped and no pulse goes at all. A pulse
already out is held and never cancelled, since dropping it and sending it again would be a new rising edge, and a turn
under way is finished. A keep goes at any speed.
Nor does any desire go out while openpilot isn't steering (carControl.latActive): modeld would not feed it to the
model, and a pulse, repeat or timeout spent then is lost. Once openpilot engages, a fresh pulse goes, unless the driver
has turned the car TURN_STARTED_DEG toward a turn meanwhile.
When a new route replaces the maneuver (RouteFollower.replaced), a turn pulse the car hasn't started turning on is
cleared at once: the old junction may be just ahead, and the pulse would turn the car there.
