"""The route's stop signs, yields and traffic signals, from Valhalla (navInstruction.controls, map_controls.py).

route_controls() takes navd's route steps and asks Valhalla two things. trace_attributes (edge_walk over the route's own
shape) gives the directed edges the route drives, with each edge's traffic_signal, its end node's traffic_signal and the
roads meeting there. Locate gives what trace_attributes doesn't: a directed edge's stop_sign and yield_sign. One batched
verbose locate, radius 1, a metre back from each edge's end, picks the candidate with the edge's own id. Valhalla puts a
control on the edge that ends at the junction, so every control is placed at the END of its edge:
  signal = the edge's traffic_signal or its end node's; stop = locate's stop_sign; yield = locate's yield_sign.
Internal intersection edges (inside a divided road's junction) are skipped.
junction: other roads meet at the end node. crossSuspect (stop and yield only): the route's road outranks every road
crossing there, so the sign is likely the cross road's (real OSM: undirected stops are flagged on every approach).
The stop line: a sim sidecar (tiles_dir/controls.json, {"controls": {"<way_id>:<f|b>": {kind, line: [lat, lon], ...}}} from
tools/sim/bridge/beamng/mapsignals.py) gives it for its controls, projected onto the route within the edge (lineMapped);
otherwise it is the edge's end less CONTROL_LINE_M. Either way less MAP_MARGIN_M. Controls within MERGE_M merge, the
signal over the stop over the yield.
Off the route (controls_ahead): the same, over the road ahead of the car instead of a route's shape. Locate (verbose, by
the car's heading) gives the edge the car is on and its shape from the car on; from its end node, the edge that carries on
nearest the bearing it arrives with (within NEXT_HEADING_TOL: the road straight on), and so on to AHEAD_M or AHEAD_EDGES.
That road is walked as a one-step route. A control at its end counts (the route's end is a destination; this road's isn't).
Past a junction the car may turn off it: navd looks again every second, and turnpilotd drops what a lookup no longer lists
(map_controls.py).
Status: ok; walkOrSnap (edge_walk failed, walk_or_snap matched it, logged); partial (more than PARTIAL_UNMATCHED of the
edges unmatched by locate); failed (nothing: both matches failed, or any exception); unsupported (tiles_dir given and it
has no controls_built marker: tiles built from data with no controls, the old sim exports). The route publishes whatever
the status: navd sends it on every message, and turnpilotd says so out loud.
