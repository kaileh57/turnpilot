"""The detector inside modeld: after modelV2 is sent, on frames modeld already uploaded, it runs YOLO26 on one camera and
publishes turnpilotDetections. The road camera sees far ahead on straights; the wide one sees the crosswalk and cross
traffic in turns. turnpilotPlan.detectorView (read through fresh_plan, shadow too) overrides that pick: the unprotected left
(unprotected_left.py) asks for the road camera from its go to its commit, whatever its turn desire (CRITIQUE REQUIRED 3).
It runs in modeld because the chestnut's USB interface is claimed by one process.

Each run on the road camera also reads the lane paint (scene/lane_paint.py) on that frame, from the host copy modeld made
of it, with the frame's modelV2 and calibration read back off the bus and the detections masking what they hide, and
publishes it in the same message, with lanePaintStatus saying why when it isn't read. A run on the wide camera reads none
on its own frame (no boxes for the road frame: unmasked, a white car over a yellow line reads as broken white paint), but
while the full pass looks through the wide camera (a turn, a curve, their WIDE_HOLD_S) the far crop's run on the frame
between reads it on that road frame, behind the far crop's boxes, where the step has room (read_odd_paint), and the next
wide run's message carries it (lanePaintStatus read): the wrong-side guard's paint on a turn's approach and exit (PF-03).
On comma's public comma four routes (lane_paint.py's, 37 turns), the guard's line was read on none of the moving approach,
turn and exit steps before and on 27%, 13% and 37% of them so (21%, 15% and 21% of the 24 in right-hand traffic, where the
guard runs), with no wrong-side fire added in any; without lane_paint's chromaticity test it added two, in a turn and an
exit. The far crop's boxes mask only its window, so the replay also read the same frames behind a full road pass's boxes
on the frame before (which the car doesn't have in a turn): the far side's ego line read broken white (the far-side
keep's evidence) on 304 of 4591 right-hand-traffic wide steps against 302 so, never where that read yellow.
A read took 7.5-8 ms on the comma four (0.79 ms on an M-series Mac), so until 11-01 the paint went off every drive and the
wrong-side guard and the lane changes had none; lane_paint.sample_lines, vectorized to the same output (2026-11-01), took
3.3-3.5 ms on the car (11-06). Its time is the time budget's (estimate()): on a road run that has room for the detector
and the lights but not the paint too, the paint is skipped (lanePaintStatus noRoom), the lights before the paint, and with
the car under PAINT_SKIP_V near a mapped signal with the light reader reading (lights_near) it is skipped outright: the
lane changes and the wrong-side guard read it only faster, the light reader standing (11-06: a 38-40 ms model, 10.4 ms
pass, 3.4 ms paint and 3.1-3.9 ms of lights at a junction's heads had no room together, so the road runs went forced only,
0.8-1.0 s apart, the 1 s camera light read aging out between them); with no reader reading there, nothing would take the
time it frees, so the paint is read as anywhere else. A paint skipped for room PAINT_FORCE_S running is read anyway, its estimate
starting over from that read, so a slow burst can't keep it skipped. Nothing turns it off: a median over PAINT_BUDGET_S
is warned once a minute (the 11-06 medians peaked at 4.29-4.59 ms against 5.0, a hair from the old off-for-the-drive
rule, against the no-features-off rule), and a failed read is retried after a backoff (lanePaintStatus retrying), logged
each time.

The traffic lights are read the same way (DESIGN phase 4 G2, detector/light_state.py): on road camera runs, from the host
copy of the frame, on the detector's class-9 boxes (decode_lights, never in the detections), with the frame's calibration
and modelV2 off the bus, into the message's lights (source camera, shadow unless TurnPilotCameraLights is addOnly), each
head with this frame's read and its reason (the gate that stopped it: 11-06's 667 night reads gave 0 greens and no colour
on 85% of plausible heads, and the log couldn't say why). Their time is the budget's too, a median over LIGHT_BUDGET_S
warned once a minute (11-06: 3.58-3.74 ms against 4.0), never off for the drive; a failed read is retried after a backoff
(lightStatus retrying), logged each time; the detector keeps running. A reader that fails LIGHT_DISABLED_FAILS reads in a
row says lightStatus disabled on its road runs (logged once) until a read succeeds, still retried: turnpilotd keeps that
read past its age-out and map_controls says it once (camera_lights_off), so a reader failing every retry all night is the
driver's to know, not only the log's (11-06 review: retrying alone reached no one). The boxes that never become heads (the
size and horizon gates, past MAX_READ_HEADS) are counted by the reader and logged with the heads' reasons at most once in
LIGHT_GATES_LOG_S (turnpilot.light_gates), for the night tuning, and each road run's message carries them, with the boxes
under MIN_CONF that read no colour, in lightRejects (logged only: every class-9 box down to LIGHT_GREEN_CONF is in lights or
lightRejects with its confidence and reason; lightBoxes stays the MIN_CONF boxes). TurnPilotCameraLights off reads none.

Which camera (choose_camera): the wide one in a turn (desiredCurvature at or above WIDE_CURVATURE while moving) and
WIDE_HOLD_S after it, at a standstill and a crawl but for one road run in WIDE_SLOW_ROAD_EVERY, else the road one; a turn
desire before the car turns, and a signal mapped near (signal_near) at a crawl or in the turn with the light reader reading
(lights_near: TurnPilotCameraLights on, out of its retry backoff), alternate them 1:1, so the light reader has road frames
from a signalized turn's pulse to its line and through a stand at a red. 11-06: below
MIN_LAT_CONTROL_SPEED modeld freezes desiredCurvature, at 0.011-0.014 at the stands, and with a turn desire also holding
the wide camera, stands within 40 m of a signal had 8-17% road runs (1e 3+10 to 3+36: none in 259), a signalized right
none from its pulse at 39 m.

The far crop (DESIGN phase 4 G5, FarCrop): a FAR_CROP_SIZE window of the road camera's frame at native resolution
(graph.Crop: twice the full pass's pixel density, a car 1.8 m wide is 9 px at 230 m), run on the model frames between the
full pass's runs and published apart (turnpilotFarDetections), so it never takes a frame the full pass is due on, forced or
not: the full pass always wins, but far first (below). It is aimed by turnpilotPlan.farCropBearing (read through
fresh_plan, shadow too: the unprotected left aims it up the oncoming approach, else straight ahead) at the calibrated
horizon (FAR_HORIZON_ROW down the crop), and one compiled graph serves every aim: it takes two byte windows of modeld's
device copy of the frame (crop_view_offsets). Its own budget: a run only where its estimate, what its step costs (the run,
its decode, its message and its send, its lights apart: FarCrop.estimate), leaves the next full pass its room (the time
budget below). Nothing of its own turns it off for the drive since 2026-11-07 (no features off): a failed run is retried
after a backoff (FAR_DISABLED_FAILS in a row say farStatus disabled, which turnpilotd raises, until one succeeds), a median
run over FAR_BUDGET_S and FAR_OVERRUNS of its last TIME_WINDOW steps past DEBT_CAP_S are warned, and FAR_FORCE_S wanting a
frame with no room drops its measured costs so it measures again; nothing of the full pass's (its runs, its backoff) changes.
On the car it went off for the drive in both 11-06 drives' first minutes (1d 79.5 s and 1e 190.6 s into their logs, after 28 and 153 runs),
all of them between two wide runs (after a road run's 5.8 ms of debt its 2.7 never fit): the room check took its 10.5 ms
run alone, its step cost 2.4 ms more, so runs it fit left 6.5-7.1 ms of debt (median; p90 7.4-8.5, a 13-15 ms run 10-11),
and three of five past DEBT_CAP_S was its off rule. Its class-9 boxes go to a light reader of its own, always in shadow, its
time and failures ruled as the full pass's lights are (never off for the drive). TurnPilotFarCrop off, or no far pkl,
runs none (farStatus off).

Far first (plan_inputs' far_first: an unprotected left in hand, turnpilotPlan.detectorView road or roadAndWide, from
VIEW_FROM_M to its commit, whose R_req is past the full pass's range: the band past it the far slot's to read), standing or
slow only (under FAR_FIRST_V: at its line, its roll-up and creep, the go's first second). Each frame goes to the pass due
first that fits on its own step cost (left_pick): the far crop's next run FAR_DUE_S after its last, the full pass's
ROAD_DUE_S after its last road run (a wide run's WIDE_DUE_S after its last, or the road's sooner: the next road run waits on
it), 4 runs a second each, under unprotected_left's ROAD_FRESH_S and FAR_FRESH_S (0.5 s since 2026-11-07, L2: a quarter of
PET_S), past which a stream's gap starts the left's clear window over. So the far crop takes a full pass's frame when it is
due sooner, the full pass then running on the next frame it fits, and between the full runs it takes a frame where its run
leaves the next full pass its room. Both judged on what their steps cost (the full pass's measured past its run, paint and
lights: full_extra_s). The paint is skipped
outright (noRoom; read_odd_paint too), the car standing or creeping freeing the step's time: nothing reads the paint there.
The slot is the far crop's, the native's only without one (left_far): a native strip's 15.4 ms beside the car's model needs
a paid-back step and another after it. Moving it is auto's schedule (the 11-06 review, 2026-11-07: far first there halved
the road runs to 5 a second, the person hard brake's 5 hits in 1 s and the light vote with no margin, for far runs the
left's latch throws away): the full pass every RUN_EVERY frames, the far slot between them where it leaves the next its room,
which beside a road run's paint on the car's budget is never, so on the approach it reads nothing, as before far first.
On 11-06's timings replayed (tests/test_far_first.py), held at the line: the far crop about 4.1 reads a second where it read
never, the road camera's runs 4.15 (6.7 before), the wide camera's 2.1 (3.3), every step's debt within DEBT_CAP_S (the old
schedule's road runs, their step's extra uncounted, passed it on 20% of steps). 10 runs a second is all the frames hold
beside the model (each run's step costs more than one frame's slack, so the frame after it pays it back), and road and far
4 a second each and the wide camera 2 ask all 10: their gaps sit on the 0.3 s edge (10 minutes at 11-06's model: 3-4 of the
road camera's 2,490 gaps past it, 8-9 of the far crop's 2,480; at a model 1 ms slower 13-17 and 38). Judged by the left's
window (test_far_first.left_waits) with every timing spread as on 11-06, an empty road certifies at once on most holds (the
wait's p90 2.5 s at 11-06's model, 4.3 s at one 1 ms slower, at most 7.2 s); at a model 2 ms slower the far crop reads 3.1 a
second and a third of its gaps pass 0.3 s, so the left waits (a median of 15-19 s, some over a minute), never shorter, and
no far gap passes STALE_UNDECIDED_S (FAR_FORCE_S), so none goes blind past ~98 m (that replica, without unprotected_left's
far_behind; the real left there waits p50 2.5 s, test_far_first.real_left_waits). unprotected_left's ROAD_FRESH_S and
FAR_FRESH_S are 0.5 s since 2026-11-07 (L2: a quarter of PET_S, what the gap rule can spare between runs). A left's road camera runs 4 a second at its line
(LEFT_ROAD_RUNS_HZ, left_range.py's). Its boxes hold the left as the full pass's do, a car going the car's own way too:
unprotected_left's band widens by BAND_TOL_DEG with range, so the car's own lane is in it from 18 m out and the lane beside
from 121 m, and a far box blocks at any range where the left needs the far slot. So a car going straight on from ahead of
the car holds it until it is past the far crop's reach (the turnpilotd Sim, a 35 mph left, that car leaving at the limit
from 10 m past the junction: gone 15 s after the hold with far boxes to 210 m, 7.8 s with none), and traffic our way in the
lane beside past 121 m holds it as long as it is boxed there. Telling it from oncoming traffic is unprotected_left's band
rule's (the 11-06 review, 2026-11-07), unchanged here: the far crop's boxes stay a car the detector sees.
At a signalized left (review 2026-11-07, R1) the light reads cost 2-4.6 ms with 1-4 heads (11-06's rlogs; this tree's reader
~1.4x on a Mac): with the far crop's shadow reads on top of its step and the full pass judged with its step's extra, neither
stream fit and an empty road's window waited p50 8-19 s, or never filled. Far first now reads no far lights (nothing acts
on them at a left), a road run due (road_due) is judged as auto judges it, its frame never the far crop's, and one a frame
past due (road_overdue, review 2026-11-07 CS-1) runs whatever its debt: at 3 road heads at the 1.55x per head measured on
this tree's reader, or 3 at 1.4x with the model 0.7 ms slower, a due road run's own step left 8-10 ms of debt and was
refused until the forced run, and the real left's empty-road wait went p50 6-10 s, p90 17-21 s. Replayed with the 11-06
spread through the real UnprotectedLeft (test_far_first.real_left_waits, both seeds), an empty road's wait is p50 2.5 s, p90
2.5 s from 1 to 4 road heads at 1.0-1.55x and the model up to 0.7 ms slower (p90 2.9-3.8 s at 2 heads 1.55x and 1.5 ms,
4.1-5.2 s at 2 ms), the road camera 3.4-4.3 runs a second (its longest gap 8 frames), the far crop 2.7-4.3; up to 19% of
steps pass DEBT_CAP_S, the latest 17.9 ms, under half a frame (the car dropped no frame at 47.9 ms on 1e).

The native schedule (TurnPilotNativeDetect, NativeStrips; full by default, Kellen's ship call; off and nothing here differs
from the far crop alone): Kellen's whole camera frame at native resolution, in the far crop's slot. strip runs graph.NATIVE_SIZES' 1344x384
full-width strip of the road frame with the horizon at FAR_HORIZON_ROW (graph.crop_at, so every bearing at once: the plan's
aim moves nothing); full runs two 1344x512 strips, the frame's top (rows 0-511) and bottom (248-759), alternating, so the
whole frame natively every 200 ms and the horizon band, in both, every 100 ms. Its runs are the far crop's message
(turnpilotFarDetections, its crop the strip's rect, boxes in road frame pixels), so tracker B, the left's far reach, the far
lights and the odd paint read take them as they take the far crop's. Where the strips meet, a near object taller than the
264 shared rows is cut in both: the top strip's bottom edge is no frame edge, so a box there is one tracker B's crop-edge
rule drops (scene/tracker.py tile_boxes), and the bottom strip holds its feet with only its head cut, which that rule keeps;
every ground object's bottom is whole in one strip. It is loaded with the detector, for the mode the param says then (a
change mid-drive to another mode takes effect at the next load; to off, at once), and has its own budget: a run only where
its estimate leaves the next full pass its room (else the far crop takes that frame if it fits: never nothing); a failure,
a median run over NATIVE_BUDGET_S, or FAR_OVERRUNS of its last TIME_WINDOW runs pushing the debt past DEBT_CAP_S send it
back to the far crop for the drive, logged and said by every full pass message (nativeStatus fallback), the far crop then on its own budget
as without it. Measured on the chestnut beside the big model on the bench (models/README.md): the step 34.86 ms median with
strip, 35.71 ms with full, against 33.39 ms with the far crop; on the car the big model alone is 13 ms slower (the time
budget below), so a strip (10.7-12 ms) has no room on the frame after a road run, and the far crop takes it where it fits.
On the car it never ran (11-06, both drives: 0 native runs beside a 38.5 ms model: a strip's 14.9-15.4 ms warm run left
6.4 ms or more of debt from a paid-back step before its step's own 2.4, and the frame between the full runs had to leave
the next full pass its 1.7-5.8 ms too, so no frame could hold it; its median over NATIVE_BUDGET_S would have sent it back
to the far crop in five runs anyway), the far crop went off for the drive in its first minutes, and every message still
said nativeStatus full and farStatus noRoom, so turnpilotd took the far view for alive and never said farViewOff. So a
schedule loaded NATIVE_NO_RUN_S without a run says nativeStatus unavailable (logged once), and with the far crop off for
the drive (or none, or failing) and no native run for NATIVE_NO_RUN_S the slot says farStatus disabled, which turnpilotd
raises. That clock counts only the slot's free, calibrated time, where no room beside the
driving model is the one thing that can keep the native from running (native_idle_s, native_hold): a stop sweep holds the
slot for its side views, TurnPilotFarCrop off turns it off, a native that finds no calibration has no horizon to run on
(a fresh install, a recalibration: the 11-06 review's probe logged 'no room' there), and a gap in the steps ran nothing
past its first STEP_GAP_S (native_gap: a host stepping below 10 Hz still runs the clock, STEP_GAP_S a step), so their time
is off the clock; and a dead slot says disabled through a sweep, never sweep (which turnpilotd takes for a live far view),
so farViewOff is said once a drive, not again after every stop-sign hold.

The stop sweep (STOP_SIGNS.md section 1.3, SideViews): turnpilotPlan.detectorView stopSweep (held at a stop or yield) or
stopSweepGo (crossing, from the commit point), read through fresh_plan, shadow too. Its even steps (the full pass's, every
RUN_EVERY) run the forward views: the full wide pass and the road camera alternating when held, the full wide pass every
time when crossing, whatever the turn desire or the wide hold after a turn. Its odd steps (the far crop's otherwise)
alternate the two side views (sideview.py: level pinholes at yaw 75 deg left and right of the calibrated axis, 768x512,
gathered from the wide frame through maps that are graph inputs), but only with the car at or under SIDE_VIEW_V_MAX: above
it the odd steps idle, so the approach costs what the detector costs today. The side views' boxes go back to the wide
camera's fisheye pixels (camera wide, view sideLeft or sideRight), each with its sectors' image quality (sectorQuality) from
the host copy of the wide frame. Their maps follow the bus's calibration: recomputed off the step (a thread) when it moves
more than sideview.RECALIB_DEG, uploaded on an odd step, the views invalid until then (sideViewStatus mapsStale). Each
view's run is governed by the time budget on its own estimate (noRoom); a failure, a median run over SIDE_BUDGET_S, or
SIDE_OVERRUNS of the last TIME_WINDOW runs pushing the debt past DEBT_CAP_S turn them off for the drive (sideViewStatus disabled,
which turnpilotd says once, sideCamerasOff), and both cycles fall back to the forward views. While a sweep runs, the lane
paint isn't read (lanePaintStatus sweep), the light reader reads colour only with a signal mapped within SWEEP_SIGNAL_M
(lightStatus sweep otherwise), every forward run publishes its class-9 boxes (lightBoxes), and the far crop is suspended
(farStatus sweep). Every message says what the side views are doing (sideViewStatus).

Stop signs (COCO 11), on every forward run under TurnPilotCameraStopSigns shadow (the default; off reads none): decoded
apart into the message's signs, each with the luma below it for plaque labelling (decoder.fill_signs), never into its
detections, so nothing stops, caps or releases on one.

The time budget (STEP_BUDGET_S, DEBT_CAP_S): the detector runs after modelV2 is sent, so a step that takes longer than
modeld's 50 ms cycle drops nothing; it only starts the next frame late, and a lighter frame after it catches up. On the car
(comma four and chestnut, 2026-11-02, build 95a27d7) the big model takes 38.9 ms median (p99 40.2, max 41.1), not the
bench's 25-27 ms, and a full pass 10.4 ms (p99 10.7) with the lane paint 3.5 ms more on the road camera: model and detector
never fit a per-frame cap of 45 ms, and the detector ran only forced, 1.27 Hz. Those forced steps (about 53 ms) dropped no
model frame: a road run started the next frame 7.8 ms late (median; max 9.8), a wide one 3.5 ms, and the model-only frame
after it was back on time. So each step's driving model time (modeld's measured model_execution_time, so a slower host backs
off) and detector work past STEP_BUDGET_S is a debt the next step starts with (paid back by the frames under it), and a run
goes only where the debt it leaves stays within DEBT_CAP_S. A run on the frames between the full runs (the far crop, the
native schedule, the side views, the odd paint read) must also leave the next full pass its room, so the full pass always
wins (a run that, for all its estimate, left it none costs the full pass a frame, paid back by the next), but far first,
where the far crop's frames are as due as the full pass's (left_pick); one that pushed the debt past DEBT_CAP_S itself
counts against its own overrun budget. With the car's numbers the full pass runs every RUN_EVERY frame with the paint,
its debt (5.8 ms on the estimate, 7.4-8.5 measured, its step's own 1.3-2.2 ms past the run uncounted) paid back on the
frame after; the far crop's step (13.7 ms on 11-06) has no room after a road run and, judged on that cost, little between
the wide runs of a turn, so it reads where it matters, far first at a left's line; a 45 ms driving model gets only forced
runs, which stay the backstop.

Nothing here runs unless TurnPilotEnabled is set and the compiled pkl for this device and camera size exists
(compile_detector.py builds it; the pkls are not in git).

SIM ONLY, the demo's stale-detection fault (DetectorHost.sim_drop): with SIMULATION=1, TurnPilotSimDropDetectionsS set to
S > 0 (the scenario runner's --drop-detections-at; CLEAR_ON_MANAGER_START) skips every detector step for S s from the
check that first reads it, so turnpilotd's deadline hands back as it would for a detector gone silent. A value still set
after its drop is no new drop; only a new value is. Without SIMULATION=1 the param is never read, so nothing on the car
can trigger it, and with it unset nothing changes.

Once it's on it stays on for the drive, and nothing here turns it off quietly: without fresh detections turnpilotd hands
control back to the driver (a soft disable), so every gap is loud. A slow spell only skips frames until a forced run,
inside turnpilotd's deadline, measures the time again, a failed run is retried with a backoff and logged, a mid-drive
TurnPilotEnabled starts it, and a fallback to the small driving model switches to that model's detector, where one
exists.

  once. That needs a pkl compiled on the small model's device, and models/ has only the chestnut's, so today a fallback
