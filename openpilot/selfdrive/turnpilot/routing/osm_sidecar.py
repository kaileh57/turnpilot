"""The OSM stop-sign sidecar on the car: the shards for a route's level-2 tiles, checked against the tiles' own stamp.

tools/turnpilot/mapserver/osm_controls.py writes, beside a region's tiles, osm_controls/<level-2 tile index>.json for every
level-2 tile, stamped with the osm_timestamp of the OSM data the tiles were built from. A corridor carries the shards of its
own tiles (maps/corridor.py) and the region's osm_timestamp in its manifest.json; a region's or the sim tiles' directory
(TurnPilotValhallaTiles) has it in meta.json. Each shard holds
  controls: {"<way_id>:<f|b>": [{kind stop|yield, line [lat, lon] or null, junction_node (0: none), stop_tag, evidence,
                                 node}, ...]}
  junctions: {"<osm node id>": {pos [lat, lon], approaches [...]}}
  rail: [{lat, lon, ways}]
  unplaced: [{node, kind, lat, lon, direction, stop_tag, why}]: the stop and give_way nodes no approach takes (route_audit)
  signals: [{node, kind signal|crossing, lat, lon, ways, direction f|b|''}]: where signal heads can stand (the signal layer);
           a shard without the key (a builder before it) leaves the layer unknown in its tile
routing/controls.py unions its stops and yields with Valhalla's flags (STOP_SIGNS.md, SG1a), and reads the signal layer
(signal_layer) for a signal's clear road straight on (controls.signal_clear_m).

load() reads the shards of every level-2 tile a route's shape passes through (each must be there: the build writes one per
tile, empty or not) and of the tiles within NEAR_DEG of it (read if there: a line on the route by a tile's edge). Its
status: ok; missing (no directory, no osm_controls/, or a shard of the route's tiles not there or unreadable: a corridor from
a server before the sidecar, or tiles built without it); stale (a shard's osm_timestamp isn't the tiles', or the tiles have
none to check it against). Anything but ok means the stops Valhalla doesn't flag are unknown, which controls.py says out
loud. Shards are cached by file (mtime and size, CACHE_MAX of them), since navd looks up the road ahead every second.
