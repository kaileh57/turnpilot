"""Too fast to turn: skip the turn rather than brake hard for it or take it at speed.

Kellen's rule (2026-10-27): during the approach to a junction turn, keep checking that the car can still get down to
a safe speed for the turn's real angle by the junction, braking comfortably. Once it can't, the turn is skipped for
good: its desire never goes out, its speed cap and the scene and lane logic for it are dropped (no hard braking for a
turn), the driver gets the turnpilotTooFastToTurn alert, and navd reroutes once the car is past the junction. The model
drives on as it would with no route.

The check, from the turn's angle (bearing_after less bearing_before) and the side of the road it turns across:
  v_safe = sqrt(A_LAT_SAFE * R),  R = corner tangent / tan(angle / 2)    (turn_speed.corner_tangent: 8 m to the curb side,
                                                                           12 m across the road)
  feasible  <=>  v_ego^2 <= v_safe^2 + 2 * A_COMFORT * max(d - v_ego * T_LAG, 0)
A_COMFORT is the hardest the turn speed cap may brake (hooks.SPEED_CAP_ACCEL_MIN, 2 m/s^2), so "feasible" means the
cap can get there within its own limit, and T_LAG is the planner's time constant from cap to accel (hooks.SPEED_CAP_TAU,
1 s), the distance covered before braking builds. A_LAT_SAFE is the turn cap's 2 m/s^2. At 90 degrees to the curb side
that is v_safe 4.0 m/s, and the latest feasible speeds are 11.4 m/s 40 m out, 18.5 m/s 100 m out and 22.9 m/s 150 m out.
The cap's own curve (1.5 m/s^2, leading the car by 2 s) stays under this one, so a car that follows the cap never skips.

The check only gates the desire's pulses. A turn is skipped after SKIP_CONFIRM_FRAMES infeasible frames in a row, so one
dead-reckoning jump doesn't skip it; meanwhile no pulse starts (feasible_now gates it). Once the desire is out the turn
is never skipped and nothing is cancelled: a turn the model has started planning is finished (cancelling mid-turn is how
you crash). Near the junction the check fails for a car rolling at the model's own corner speed, which is one more
reason it can't cancel. It still gates the repeat pulses and a fresh pulse on re-engaging (the old 10 m/s gate's job):
a car the driver sped up isn't sent into the turn again from road speed.
Nor does a turn's first pulse go out late: gate 1's model took a turn from a pulse 40 m out and not from 10-20 m, and a
pulse at or past the junction turns the car into the curb or the oncoming lanes. A turn whose desire hasn't gone out by
MIN_FIRST_PULSE_M (between those two) while openpilot is steering is skipped as above, reason tooLate: one that comes up
that close (navd moves past a bend or a straight-on step only 10 m beyond it), or one openpilot engages for that late.
With openpilot not steering no desire goes out at all, and the driver turning there isn't skipped under them. A pulse
again for a turn whose desire did go out (on the entry, re-engaging, pulling away) isn't a first pulse.
A turn just past a bend or a straight-on step (route_follower.py: RouteFollower.ahead) becomes the maneuver only once
the car is NAVD_ADVANCE_M past that step, at whatever distance it then has: one under MIN_FIRST_PULSE_M away already is
certain to be skipped tooLate then, which for a turn 10 m or less past the step is at or past its junction. So the skip
is announced (SkipState.ahead_skipped) from the moment the turn ahead is that close, before the junction.
Only junction turns (route_follower.TURN) are checked. A keep (slight turns, forks, ramps) is taken at speed by the
model, and its desire goes at any speed.
