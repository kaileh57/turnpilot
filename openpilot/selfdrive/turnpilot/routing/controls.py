"""The route's stop signs, yields and traffic signals, from Valhalla and the OSM stop-sign sidecar (navInstruction.controls,
map_controls.py).

route_controls() takes navd's route steps and asks Valhalla two things. trace_attributes (edge_walk over the route's own
shape) gives the directed edges the route drives, with each edge's traffic_signal, its end node's traffic_signal and the
roads meeting there. Locate gives what trace_attributes doesn't: a directed edge's stop_sign and yield_sign. One batched
verbose locate, radius 1, a metre back from each edge's end, picks the candidate with the edge's own id. Valhalla puts a
control on the edge that ends at the junction, so every control is placed at the END of its edge:
  signal = the edge's traffic_signal or its end node's; stop = locate's stop_sign; yield = locate's yield_sign.
The OSM sidecar (routing/osm_sidecar.py, from sidecar_dir) adds what Valhalla misses: it sets no stop_sign on about a
quarter of the OSM-mapped stop approaches (research_allway.md section 0). Its entries for the edge's way and direction
("<way_id>:<f|b>", a list, since a way passes several junctions) are the edge's when the entry's line, the OSM stop node,
projects inside the edge's span on the route within LINE_TOL_M of it (past SPAN_START_M from its start, which is the
previous edge's end), or, for a stop on the junction node (no line), when that node is within NODE_TOL_M of the edge's
end. The edge's stops and yields are the union of both, but for an orphan (an entry the sidecar ties to no junction,
junction_node 0: a mid-block trail or rail crossing, or a reversed direction tag) whose sign is more than ORPHAN_NEAR_M
before its anchor edge's end: that end less CONTROL_LINE_M would stop the car where there is no sign, up to a kilometre
past the real one (Indianapolis: 146 of the 176 such orphans more than 15 m past), so it is left out and logged (route_audit
lists it as uncovered), as the base had it; never placed at its sign instead, since a reversed tag would then stop the car
past a junction. But an orphan, near its edge's end or far, with a mapped rail crossing within RAIL_M past its sign on the
route (rail_ahead: the tracks ahead confirm its direction tag; a reversed one has them behind it) stops the car at its sign,
never nearer the crossing's node than RAIL_CLEAR_M (one in a median before the first carriageway, as below): a stop or
yield of its own there (that edge's end may be past the tracks), never moved on by a survey of the junction at that end,
whose junction always carries the rail crossing (railDistance: certify's geometry, so SG2 routes around it, or an
unavoidable one is a stop and a handback, C7); rail crossings reach the car only that way. Either is still ours on the
edge for phantom(). One exception: Valhalla flags both directions of a stop on a graph node it can't direct (a
crosswalk's, shared with a footway), so the other direction's directed stop sitting ON the edge's end node (within
PHANTOM_NODE_M) makes a phantom of our flag of its kind there: dropped, and logged, but only when the sidecar has nothing
of ours on the edge (any kind, directed, both-ways, undirected, with a junction or none) and no
undirected or both-ways one keyed the other way inside it (phantom()). A missing entry for us proves nothing by itself
(the sidecar may not have tied the stop to a junction), so every other case keeps Valhalla's flag: an extra stop is
cheap, a dropped real one isn't.
Internal-intersection edges (inside a divided road's junction) are searched too; a control on one is the preceding
junction's (the end of the last edge before them), so a stop mapped in a median stops the car before the first
carriageway. One edge end is one node, and its kinds are one control, the signal over the stop over the yield; controls at
different nodes never merge, however close (STOP_SIGNS.md G11, G18).
junction: other roads meet at the end node. crossSuspect (stop and yield only): the route's road outranks every road
crossing there, so the sign is likely the cross road's.
The stop line: a sim sidecar (tiles_dir/controls.json, {"controls": {"<way_id>:<f|b>": {kind, line: [lat, lon], ...}}} from
tools/sim/bridge/beamng/mapsignals.py) gives the sim's real lines, projected onto the route within the edge (lineMapped,
line source sim). Otherwise the edge's end less CONTROL_LINE_M (line source default), for Valhalla's controls and the
sidecar's alike, or less SIGNAL_NODE_LINE_M for a signal on a node no other road meets (its stop line's own node). Either way
less MAP_MARGIN_M. The OSM stop node never sets it: it marks a sign, not a line, 20-40 m back
on some approaches, and a yield moved back to its sign would end map_controls' YIELD_SPEED cap well short of the merge.
It is carried as data only (osm_sign_m: the sign nearest the junction on the control's own edge, for route_audit). A stop or
yield's stop point (never a signal's) then moves back to junctions.stop_offset's rule where the cross road's lanes are known
(node - 13 m for 2 lanes, 16.7 m for 4: SG1b, G15), never forward, or to a counting survey's stopPointM. osm_node is the
OSM junction the sidecar says the control governs (0 when it has none).
Off the route (controls_ahead): the same, over the road ahead of the car instead of a route's shape. Locate (verbose, by
the car's heading) gives the edge the car is on and its shape from the car on; from its end node, the edge that carries on
nearest the bearing it arrives with (within NEXT_HEADING_TOL: the road straight on), and so on to AHEAD_M or AHEAD_EDGES.
That road is walked as a one-step route. A control at its end counts (the route's end is a destination; this road's isn't).
Past a junction the car may turn off it: navd looks again every second, and turnpilotd drops what a lookup no longer lists
(map_controls.py).
Status: ok; walkOrSnap (edge_walk failed, walk_or_snap matched it, logged); partial (more than PARTIAL_UNMATCHED of the
edges unmatched by locate, or the OSM sidecar missing or stale where one is expected: the stops Valhalla misses are
unknown; logged, and each stop and yield's junction_status is failed); failed (nothing: both matches failed, or any
exception); unsupported (tiles_dir given and it has no controls_built marker: tiles built from data with no controls, the
old sim exports). The route publishes whatever the status: navd sends it on every message, and turnpilotd says so out loud.
sidecar_dir None means no sidecar is expected (synthetic tests); navd's sources always pass one (routing/sources.py).
The junction (SG1b): each stop and yield carries its junction (junction_info, routing/junctions.py: the roads there, the
road the route leaves by, their controls, lanes, limits and all-way tiers, the survey, the maneuver, the rail distance),
read from trace_attributes and Q2, one more batched verbose locate per route that also carries the opposing roads' probes
(opposing_roads, for the unprotected left: given an Opposing, a route makes Q1 and Q2 and no third). A failed Q2 leaves
every leg unknown and the junction failed. A suspected unmapped stop (N5: every road crossing outranks ours by two
classes or more, junctions.suspected_stop, and nothing mapped on our whole approach, approach_edges: no signal, stop or
yield from Valhalla or the sidecar back to the previous road junction or JUNCTION_AHEAD_M, and no suspected stop already
at a junction within SAME_JUNCTION_M before it, and no signal across a median Valhalla doesn't flag, signal_across: at
the far carriageway of the same cross road or on the median's split node, within SAME_JUNCTION_M on) is emitted as a
stop at the default stop point, its junction flagged suspected. A route, a reroute and a lookup ahead all start at the
car, so where that walk reaches the trace's start within JUNCTION_AHEAD_M the rest of the approach is behind the car:
signal_behind walks it back by locate, and a signal there (the car is past its stop-line node) means no suspected stop,
so none on a green; nothing there, or a road behind that can't be read (logged), keeps the stop. Mapped controls at
different nodes still never merge. A TurnPilotJunctionOverrides navd can't read fails every stop and yield junction and
makes the status partial, logged. Off the route a LocateCache keeps Q1, Q2 and signal_behind's answers by edge id
between the 1 Hz lookups.
navd's own Control also carries, for SG2's avoidance loop, its approach edge's key, its exclusion point and whether that
edge is the route's first or last.
The exits (exit_edges, Exits): off the same trace, the edge the route leaves each maneuver's junction by, with the same kind
of key and exclusion point mirrored onto it, for routing around a left the car won't take (routing/lefts.py).
