"""Lane planner: get into the lane a turn leaves from, one nav lane change at a time, each warned of, confirmed and
checked until it starts.

Which lane the car is in comes from what the model sees: lanes either side counted from the room between the
ego lane's line and the road edge, at about 3.6 m a lane, but only where the next line out is painted (room
alone counts shoulders and parking strips as lanes). modelV2 can't tell a yellow line from a white one, and on
an undivided road its far road edge lies beyond the oncoming lanes; the lane paint read off the road camera
(scene/lane_paint.py, one entry per modelV2 lane line) can. US markings say what is beyond a line: broken white
is a lane going the same way, solid white an edge, shoulder, bike or parking lane, yellow oncoming traffic or a
divided road's left edge.

Where to go (desired_changes): with the map's lane list (NavInstruction.lanes) the car's lane is counted from the curb
side, which is always its own direction's, and lanes beyond a yellow line count 0. That count is known only where the model
can make it: a curb lane often has no edge line, and one lane in from it the model sees room for a lane but no line, so it
can't tell the curb lane from the one beside it. The changes made for the maneuver are counted too (LanePlanner.done), and
the lane dead reckoned from where the first of them started: no more changes than the lane list needs from there, and none
from a lane it can't place. A change is counted only once the model's lines show the car got over (LineWatch), or its lane
counts moved over: DesireHelper ends a change the same way whether or not it did. One that ends without, or a line crossed
with no change of DesireHelper's (openpilot off, a manual change), leaves the lane unknown, and a lane the model places is
never overridden by the count (nav_lane_span). A lane it can't place is said out loud (lane_unknown:
turnpilotPlan.laneMismatch laneUnknown) instead of changed from. On the far side from the curb only the list's own lanes
are lanes (nav_room): on an undivided road the model's far road edge lies
beyond the oncoming lanes (BeamNG, 2026-10-27: a second change left across a double yellow into the oncoming lane). Without it (the usual case: OSM tags
lanes on few roads) an exit moves toward the curb by the model's lane count, but not across a curb-side line read solid
white, and a turn, or an exit away from the curb, moves one lane toward its side at a time, looked at again after each
change. A far-side turn whose list's lanes are its far-most (far_bay: [left (active), straight, straight]) wants no change
while its bay hasn't opened: the far-side ego line read yellow, uncontested by white reads of it, the car beside the centre
line, until that line reads white (the bay rule, desired_changes, BayLatch; drive 1e seg 5, 2026-11-06, wanted +2 against
the yellow on a one-lane approach), and nothing says it is in the wrong lane for the turn (lane_mismatch). Only on a list
that marks the turn's lanes itself, never on a guess for one that marks none (far_bay).

Whether the next change may go (change_blocker), on every path, map lanes or not: only into a valid travel lane, which
means all of
- the ego line that way reads broken white at BROKEN_WHITE_CONF_MIN or better, or the reader read it but couldn't make it
  out and the rest agrees a lane of ours is beyond it (lane_agreed: the model sees the line and counts a painted lane beyond
  it, and the line read white, the line beyond read yellow, or the map's lane list has a lane of ours there, toward the far
  side only over a line its reads have cleared; only on a frame whose paint was read, and only while the ego line has read
  neither yellow nor solid since the car's last lane change, unless WHITE_CLEAR_FRAMES white reads of it or the yellow
  moving out came after, LineMarks). Solid, yellow, no line, or no paint read at all (no detector, the wide camera, a stale
  scene) is no change. A yellow read keeps vetoing for YELLOW_HOLD_S and YELLOW_HOLD_M after the last one, so a worn stretch
  doesn't open a gap, unless the yellow moves out a lane (the ego line read white and the line beyond yellow,
  YELLOW_OUT_FRAMES frames of the two since its last yellow or solid read: a turn bay opening, YellowHold); the
  hold moves with the lines in a lane change, and covers all four lines when the direction of one is unknown. After it a
  white read keeps its colour across reads of unknown colour for WHITE_HOLD_S or WHITE_HOLD_M, whichever ends first
  (WhiteHold: a dashed line's colour drops out before its kind does); never over solid, yellow or no line. A frame valid by
  that hold alone keeps an offer's confirm count and keeps an offer up, but nothing is offered, requested or placed for
  LC-03 on it (LanePlanner._held_only). One exception, the owner's ruling for turn bays: the one change that lands in a lane
  the map's lane list marks for the coming turn (bay_named) may cross a line read solid white (bay_line_toward: many bays open
  behind a solid white stretch, and night paint reads solid), the room beyond it counted as beyond broken white; never one
  read or held yellow, never a solid line of no colour, and LC-03 still judges the window's end without it;
- the model sees a lane that way, its next line out at least LANE_MIN lane widths beyond the ego line (an 8 ft parking
  strip beside an 11 ft lane is 0.73, a 6 ft bike lane beside a 10 ft one 0.61), not beyond a yellow line; or, with that
  line unseen (at night the usual case), the ego line read broken white and a trusted road edge LANE_MIN lane widths beyond
  it: one lane (lanes_toward), never more, so never one beyond the next line out. The lane width there is the ego lines'
  own spacing when one of them is sure (model_lanes: at night the curb-side line rarely is);
- nothing stopped in that lane ahead (parked cars: a parking strip), and nothing coming toward the car in it (an oncoming
  lane, whatever its line reads: oncoming_in_lane);
- under US markings (MUTCD) only: in left-hand traffic the center line is broken white, so nothing goes away from the curb
  there, and nothing tells right-hand Europe (white center lines too) from the US.
Before the paint, a change toward the curb before a junction turn put the car in a parking strip (BeamNG, 2026-10-27).

How a change goes (LanePlanner): once the same change is wanted for LC_CONFIRM_FRAMES (LC_BAY_CONFIRM_FRAMES for the one
change into a turn lane the lane list names, bay_named, late in its window, whose window also ends later:
lane_change_window's bay; a bay never entered by that end is still LC-03's to skip), the driver is warned LC_WARN_S
ahead: laneChangeOffer says the side (selfdrived raises turnpilotLaneChangeLeft/Right, a chime) and laneChangeCountdown the
seconds left. On cars where openpilot can't signal (the Tesla: opendbc has no blinker command), the driver's stalk is the
go-ahead, at any point in the countdown or after it until the window's end, the side's chime repeating (since 2026-11-08:
8 s after it before, which a driver who hadn't noticed the prompt ran out on, route 29); elsewhere the request goes when the
countdown ends. On the driver's path the driver's blinker on the offered side confirms the lane: a frame read short of
broken white with nothing contrary, or read by nobody, no longer holds the request back (_follow_up). The request is the
lane change itself: DesireHelper takes it with no blinker or nudge and none of the driver's 20 mph floor, only a moving
car (NAV_LANE_CHANGE_SPEED_MIN), and still waits for the car's own blind spot signal (Tesla DAS_status).
Until DesireHelper starts the change, every frame checks it
again, and any failure aborts it, with laneChangeAbort saying why for ABORT_HOLD_S (selfdrived raises
turnpilotLaneChangeAborted): the line read solid, yellow (held included) or none, or the lane no longer valid (a line read
short of broken white with nothing contrary, its kind or colour unknown, or broken white by the white hold alone, a frame
with no paint read at all, or no lane by the model's count alone with the count unknown, waits instead, nothing requested
on that frame, for LC_UNSURE_MAX_S at most: soft_block, _follow_up; before the offer the same frames keep its confirm
count), the blind spot
occupied, a car in
the target lane, no signal in time (or the blinker off before the change started), the route changed, the change no
longer needed, the car too slow or too close to the maneuver, DesireHelper waiting too long. Once the change has started
nothing cancels it: the car is already moving over. Where the car works its own turn signal (turnpilot/car_signals.py,
a verified Tesla), the lamp goes on with the warning and the request waits, past the countdown, until it has been lit for
the legal distance (litM >= leadM, IC 9-21-8-25), and the driver's lamp the other way or hazards (the port's block) are
the driver declining the change: aborted noSignal. The window opens early enough for that lead and the change itself, so
the car is in its lane by the window's end (lane_change_window's room_s), and between two changes the same way the lamp
stays lit (signal_side), the second's lead its whole run, but no more than LC_UNSURE_MAX_S past the cooldown with no frame
passing change_blocker that way by its own read. Who signals is latched per offer: one made with the car signalling
keeps the car's path unless the car's signal fails (then the driver's path, prompted); one made with the driver
signalling keeps it to its end. A change the driver makes alone gets the same cooldown before the next
offer, for the lines to settle. TurnPilotLanePaintActive off plans no change at all; turnpilotd then publishes what this
would have asked for in laneChangePaintRule.

Under TurnPilotAlwaysDrive (ALWAYS_DRIVE.md step S4; LanePlanner.always_drive, handed over every frame), Kellen's blind spot
rule. A blind spot that reads occupied once a change is offered holds it instead of aborting it (LC-01): the offer stays up
(laneChangeHold blindspot, its line silent), any request is withdrawn, so DesireHelper, which starts a requested change the
instant the blind spot clears, never goes on its own, and LC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S doesn't run while it
reads occupied (LC-02). Once it has read clear LC_HOLD_CLEAR_S the change is said again, with the lane change chime, and
counted down LC_RELEASE_S (laneChangeHold clear) before the request: the driver hears it when a held change goes. Occupied
again inside the countdown, it is held again with nothing sent. With the driver signalling, the stalk let go while only the
blind spot holds the change asks for it again (WAIT) instead of aborting noSignal. The hold lasts to the window's end
(tooLate, then LC-03) or anything else's abort: the line, the lane, a car TurnPilot's cameras see in it (R13), the route, the
speed. Before an offer a blind spot still keeps it back. Nothing tells a blind spot signal stuck at SNA from a car beside it
(opendbc's Tesla carstate reads DAS_blindSpotRearLeft != 0, LC-04), so SNA holds every change to its window's end and LC-03
skips the turn, said each time; a stale DAS_status fails carState's CAN check (inputs_valid): no change. Saying 'Blind Spot
Monitor Unavailable' once waits on opendbc carrying SNA (ALWAYS_DRIVE.md S7). The owner's yes to 4.10: toward the curb only,
a change may go on less than paint (curb_lane_unpainted): the line that way read short of broken white but not solid, yellow
or no line, on no frame of the window solid or yellow, the model's next line out a lane's width beyond it with a trusted
edge, the lane not parked, no car in it and the blind spot clear, the countdown said first as for any change. Only on a
frame whose paint the reader read: turnpilotd hands over none unless the detector's lanePaintStatus is read (plan_paint),
and the planner looks before the yellow hold, which gives a frame with none read four lines, the held one yellow and the
rest unknown (YellowHold.apply). An offer of it waits on a frame with none read, and on one read short of it with nothing
contrary, nothing requested (_follow_up), so it goes only on paint read. Toward the far side the paint rule stands
(lane_agreed's included), and so does a far-side keep's (keep_blocker).

A map stop between the car and the maneuver (stop_d: MapControlPolicy.stop_ahead) inside the window (BeamNG lane_change on
the signal tiles, 2026-10-28: a signal 164 m before the turn, and braking for it kept the car under DesireHelper's speed
minimum from 227 m in, so no change was offered). Its braking curve takes the car under that minimum slow_zone(v) before
it, so no change starts there (the window's end moves out to it), and the window opens early enough before that for the
offer, its warning and DesireHelper's start (LC_PRE_LEAD_S). With less room than LC_OFFER_ROOM_S at speed before the slow
zone, the change goes after the stop's go when the road from the stop to the window's end can take the car up to speed
and through an offer (AFTER_GO_M): wait afterStop until then. With neither, the lane is unreachable: said (wait
unreachable, and the reason), and where the map's lane list places the car in a lane the maneuver doesn't leave from,
LaneDecision.unreachable: turnpilotd skips the maneuver by the too-fast rules (turn_skip.py: out loud, navd reroutes),
never a turn from the wrong lane or a change too late. Every frame LaneDecision.wait says why a change the route wants
isn't offered (turnpilotPlan.laneChangeWait), and want how many it wants (laneChangeWant), whatever the car's speed.

A change the route still wants at the window's end (LC-03, ALWAYS_DRIVE.md 4.11): whatever held it (the blind spot, a car in
the target lane, the car too slow for DesireHelper and so never offered one, no signal, DesireHelper waiting too long, the
lane parked, the line solid), with the car placed in a lane the maneuver doesn't leave from, the turn isn't pulsed from that
lane across the next one: LaneDecision.blocked, and turnpilotd skips the maneuver out loud as for an unreachable lane
(skipReason laneBlocked: "Can't Reach Turn Lane", navd reroutes), unless its desire has gone out. Judged once a maneuver, on
the first frame at or past lane_change_window's end with nothing offered or under way, and held for it. Placed: by the map's
lane list (every lane the car may be in is one the maneuver doesn't leave from, lane_unconfirmed false); without one, by a
frame of the window on which the model read both ego lines and change_blocker found a travel lane that way (since the car's
last lane change: the lane it changed from was no evidence about the one it is in). A window that only ever read the line
solid or the lane parked doesn't place it: a bike lane behind solid white, a parking strip; and a lane found by the room
beyond the line alone (no line seen beyond it) places nothing once a stopped car is seen in it on any frame of the window,
the room between parked cars a parking strip's (2026-11-07: 1e 722-737 s, replayed through the planner before it, that
right skipped). The one exception is noLane at the
window's end (the model sees no lane that way, or one only beyond a yellow line): the lane list may be wrong, or the car is
at the edge already, and the turn goes as before. The bay rule's turn wants none there (desired_changes), so is never blocked
for a bay that hasn't opened. That makes the bay's latch (BayLatch) the permissive answer: one shut by a lane divider misread
yellow would pulse the turn from the curb lane across the through lanes, so it is judged on the line's own reads, at a higher
bar, and a white read of the line near them contests it.

At night (drive 1e, 2026-11-06, after dark): 0 offers on 16,798 plan frames, every change of the drive the driver's own;
waits lineNotBroken 777 frames, noLane 314, pastWindow 3293. The model's next line out is what goes unseen in the dark
(lanes_toward), a dashed line's colour drops out between dashes (WhiteHold), and an offer died on one such frame
(_follow_up). The yellow rail is as it was: the yellow hold is applied before the white, an ego line read or held yellow is
never crossed (and aborts an offer at once), the room beyond broken white counts one lane, never one past the next line, and
a request, an offer or LC-03's placement goes only on a frame whose own read is broken white, never on the white hold's.

Night, the second pass (2026-11-07, Kellen: "we wanna get over to the right before a right turn and the left before a
left"; no give-ups for lack of a read; a safety driver signals every change, the car's lamps beyond it). The working tree's
TurnPilot.plan replayed open loop over 1d and 1e, the lane planner's inputs recorded and run through 2bd8bc25c's planner and
this one, a driver answering each prompt 1 s on: 2bd8bc25c's offered 4 changes, none on an engaged frame (1e segs 12-13 and 1d seg 4,
driven by hand), and none for the turns the driver changed lanes for himself; this offers 3 on engaged frames, each at a
left's turn bay as it opened: 1d seg 9's at 96.8 m (requested at 84.3 m, the driver's own blinker on from 106 m and his
change at 81 m), 1e seg 5's at 226.6 m (requested from 215.6 m, then held by a car stopped in the bay), 1d seg 8's at 63 m
(3.2 m/s in a queue, aborted tooSlow). What held them: the lane width the next line out was measured against
(model_lanes), the centre line's yellow hold across the bay opening (YellowHold's yellow moving out), the bay's line read
but not made out (lane_agreed), and every frame short of a pass starting the confirm count over (soft_block). Where nothing
changed: the curb-side rights, the car at the curb on all of them (the right edge 0.1-0.9 m beyond a line the model is
unsure of: no lane); a sharp left's lane beyond a line read solid with its traffic oncoming (1e 364-367 s, held by the rail,
the driver crossing it himself); a left whose line read yellow on 115 of 314 frames (1e 589-614 s, the yellow rail).

Its review (2026-11-07) found three ways that pass agreed a lane over a centre line: a frame nobody read, padded to four
lines by the yellow hold, agreed by a held yellow beyond or the list (lane_agreed now only on paint read); the far side's
list over a line never read white (now only over one cleared, LineMarks); and one white read clearing a mark and, with one
yellow read beyond, ending the hold (1e 243.35-244.85 s; now YELLOW_OUT_FRAMES and WHITE_CLEAR_FRAMES frames). The replays
of 1d and 1e offer and request the same changes at the same distances as before them; 5 frames a change left may go by
the frame's own read are gone from the two drives (the four of 1e 244.38-244.79 s, and 1d 576.25 s, the bay's yellow beyond
read once, a frame before its tenth frame of evidence)."""

    map's lane list has a lane of ours that way from wherever the car may be in it (nav_room >= 1, None without a list),
    toward the far side only over an ego line cleared (cleared: LineMarks, read white WHITE_CLEAR_FRAMES times since its last
    yellow or solid read, or the yellow moved out a lane from it). Toward the far side the model counts the oncoming lane
    beyond a centre line as readily as a lane of ours, and on a far_bay approach the list is the junction's (desired_changes'
    bay rule), so there the list alone is no sign over a line whose colour was never read white.
  The planner asks this only with that way's ego line unmarked (LineMarks, LanePlanner._unread_ok: no yellow or solid read
  of it since the car's last lane change, unless WHITE_CLEAR_FRAMES white reads of it or the yellow moving out came after),
  so a centre line read yellow once is never crossed on unread frames after the yellow hold runs out; and only on a frame
  whose paint the reader read (turnpilotd's plan_paint hands over none unless it did, and the planner asks on four lines as
  they came in, before the yellow hold pads a frame nobody read to four: 2026-11-07 review, a far-left line read yellow once
  and every frame after it unread was agreed by its hold, offered and requested), so a frame nobody read is no agreement.

  the start. lane_agreed crosses a line the reader couldn't make out only while it is unmarked (LanePlanner._unread_ok), and
  toward the far side takes the map's lane list as a sign only once it is cleared (LanePlanner._cleared).

  Marked: the yellow hold keeps a yellow read for YELLOW_HOLD_S and YELLOW_HOLD_M; a centre line can go unread longer than
  that at night (1d and 1e, 2026-11-06: three of the thirty unsure stretches of an ego line between two reads of it 3.6-7.3

  hold run out the agreement would be the oncoming lane's. One white read cleared it before (2026-11-07 review): 1e 243.35
  s, a centre line read yellow 3.3 s earlier read unknown kind white 0.61 on 2 frames, and lane_agreed crossed it on 4

  clears it as it ends the hold (1d 575.5-576.3 s; 1e 306.82 s).

  Cleared, for the far side's map-list sign: there the model's count can't tell our lane from the oncoming one beyond a
  centre line, and on a far_bay approach the list is the junction's, placing the car a lane or two short of its bay
  (desired_changes' bay rule); so the list says a lane of ours is there only over a line read white. Before (2026-11-07

    the car's lamp going dark between them (the turn not armed yet) started its 300 ft lead over, and the second change of a
    three-lane road had no window left for it. The carry lengthens one continuous request by a cooldown and an offer (tens
    of seconds at most), well inside the port's own cap on one (opendbc car_signal.REQUEST_CAP_S, 300 s). Past the cooldown
    it lasts while the next change could be offered: LC_UNSURE_MAX_S with no frame passing change_blocker that way by its
    own read puts it out (its clock stopped while that way's blind spot reads occupied; update), so with the line unread
    the lamp is dark LC_COOLDOWN_S + LC_UNSURE_MAX_S after a change, not lit to the window's end (2026-11-06 review: 13.35 s)."""
