"""The route's stop signs, yields and traffic signals between navd's 1 Hz fixes (navInstruction.controls).

navd sends each control's distance once a second from the GPS projection onto the route. A projection at standstill is
pure noise (2 m of it walked the old junction hold 4 m over its line), and one a second jumps by the GPS error, so the
distance here is dead-reckoned with vEgo every frame, and a fresh fix pulls it at most CORRECTION_M (none while slower
than FREEZE_SPEED). A fix more than JUMP_M off is a re-initialisation, logged (turnpilot.control_jump), and the policy
re-checks whether the stop is still feasible (map_controls.py).

A control's identity is (routeCount, id), never the maneuver: a skipped turn or a straight-through junction keeps its
stop. A new route (a reroute) drops the controls the car wasn't stopping for yet, and keeps an engaged or held one: a
same-kind control of the new route within ADOPT_M of it takes over its state (it is the same one), and one the new route
doesn't list is carried under its old key until passed. A held control is never dropped and its distance is frozen:
the latch is the policy's, position-free.
A gap in the route (an invalid navInstruction, or none for NAV_STALE_S) is dead-reckoned through, for GAP_MAX_M of
travel; then every control but a held one is dropped, and listed in lost for the policy to say so.

Off the route with a destination (navd rerouting, no route yet, off it for a fix), navd looks up the controls on the road
ahead of the car itself once a second (navInstruction.offRouteControls, routing/controls.py: controls_ahead). Those are
the controls then, under (OFF_ROUTE, id), each lookup a fix as above: the stale route's go once one is in, as they're
nowhere the car is going (BeamNG route_demo, 2026-10-28: the old route's signal dead-reckoned 106 m out while the car drove
through the one on its road). An engaged one of theirs is taken over by a lookup's same-kind control within ADOPT_M, a held
one stays. One a lookup no longer lists goes, an engaged one after OFF_ROUTE_MISS lookups in a row (one is a GPS hiccup; two,
the car turned off that road). A route again takes over the engaged off-route ones the same way.
Off the route with a destination and nothing known ahead (off_route_unknown), past OFF_ROUTE_GRACE_S: the lookup pending,
failed, unsupported or partial, or none fresh for OFF_LOOKUP_STALE_S (navd gone quiet). The policy caps the speed and says so.
