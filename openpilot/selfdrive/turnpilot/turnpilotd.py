"""turnpilotd: turns the active route and the scene into desire pulses, lane-change requests and longitudinal limits.

modeld takes the plan's desire and lane change, plannerd its accel and speed caps (see hooks.py). The lane paint the
detector reads comes in with its detections, and is used only while those are fresh (the scene is available) and the
message's lanePaintStatus is read (plan_paint); none read is unknown paint, and no lane change. The lane planner plans
lane changes only with TurnPilotLanePaintActive set; without it a second planner publishes what it would have asked for
in laneChangePaintRule, so drives can be scored. In shadow mode
(TurnPilotShadowMode) everything is computed and published with shadow=True, and nothing acts on it.
It runs onroad only while TurnPilotEnabled. The manager doesn't restart a process that died, and a dead one
soft-disables openpilot for the rest of the drive (processNotRunning), so an exception in the plan or the scene is
logged and a disabled plan or an empty scene goes out instead.

TurnPilot acts only while it can do its job (Kellen, 2026-10-27: no degraded mode, and every failure loud):
- Not until the detector's first fresh results after TurnPilot is turned on (state unavailable, "waiting for the
  detector"): modeld loads it only while disengaged, so a mid-drive enable can't be handed back before it ever ran.
  A detector with no results DETECTOR_START_DEADLINE_S of modelV2 frames after that (no pkl, a failed load, none for the
  driving model) never started: handback noDetector. modeld publishes no modelV2 while it loads the detector, so the
  load itself doesn't count against it. Nor do frames with openpilot engaged (carControl.enabled) before modeld had
  its chance to load it, LOAD_CHANCE_S disengaged with TurnPilot on: turned on and engaged within modeld's param check,
  it waits for a disengage, and TurnPilot waits with it. Never silently, though: DETECTOR_START_DEADLINE_S from the
  first engaged frame with no detection yet (whatever modeld publishes, engaged or not since), it is noDetector too. A
  load that failed while the driver engaged during it (modeld publishes nothing while it loads) is handed back so.
- Once it has run, DETECTOR_DEADLINE_S without fresh results is a stopped detector. modeld's own skips stay inside it: a
  slow spell forces a run every 0.8 s however long it lasts (modeld_detector.FORCE_RUN_S), a failed run retries after
  1 s. A second failure in a row, or a forced run that itself takes too long, is past it.
- Not while the cameras aren't calibrated (extrinsicsCalibration's calStatus not calibrated, calibration_wait): the
  tracker takes no run before then (scene/tracker.py: nothing can be ranged), so the scene is unavailable whatever the
  detector does, and an OS update that reset calibration read "detector not running" for a car that was only calibrating.
  TurnPilot doesn't act (state unavailable, its reason calibrationd's progress: "calibrating cameras: 45%"), hands nothing
  back but a model fallback, and neither deadline runs: their clocks hold through it, calibration time being no detector
  failure, and run on from where they were once it's done. openpilot's own calibration events say it too and keep it from
  engaging (or soft-disable it, on a recalibration mid-drive, where TurnPilot drops what it was doing as on a handback).
- A modelV2 from the small model after one from the big model is a fallback (modelV2.big), which pauses TurnPilot. So is
  modeld's ChestnutActive False (read in main()) while modelV2 isn't the big model's: it outlives this process, which
  TurnPilot turned off and on restarts, and covers a big model that failed to load.
  A pause isn't the drive's end (2026-11-01, the first drive: one USB glitch ended TurnPilot and wiped the route):
  modeld retries the chestnut in the background (modeld/chestnut_recovery.py) and brings the big model back with
  openpilot disengaged. The route is kept (NavDestination stays, navd keeps routing, the follower tracks it), and every
  surface says why (PAUSED_REASON: the soft disable's alert, the status line, the nav view, the phone). Once modelV2 is
  the big model's again (BIG_BACK_REASON) TurnPilot resumes at the driver's next engagement (watch_model): a frame
  disengaged with the big model back, then an engaged one, said with a chime (turnpilotResumed), its detector's start
  deadlines run afresh (the small model ran none). A drive the driver engaged on the small model as plain openpilot is
  never taken over silently: that engagement predates the big model's return, so it takes a disengage and an engage.
On either, plan.handback is set and selfdrived soft-disables (handback.py). TurnPilot stops at once: no new desire,
lane change, signal prompt, skipped-turn reroute or wrong-lane flag, and the maneuver in hand is dropped. A turn whose
desire already went out is never cancelled (desire_timing.py): its desire is held, with no new pulse, and cleared from
the model at the turn's angle as usual; a keep desire is dropped. The scene's stops in force stay, as does the stop for want
of a green at the signal of the turn in hand (update()'s junction), and so does the turn speed cap of a turn whose desire
already went out: a handback must not speed the car up. Nor does the route going away
under a committed turn cancel it (route_follower.py: gaps, navd going quiet, reroutes are dead-reckoned through). Nor does a cap the car
was slowing for going away with the maneuver or the route: from the handback until openpilot stops steering (the soft
disable's end) the speed cap holds the car at no more than its speed then, and at no more than it has slowed to since
(hold_v), or than the driver's gas has taken it to.
A fault (plan()) is a disabled plan; it carries the handback, so a fault never hides one, and the detector's deadlines
and the scene's stops in force run on through it (only turning TurnPilot off resets them). So does a committed turn:
its route and desire state are kept (its desire, dropped by the disabled plan, pulses again only as on re-engaging), its
junction dead-reckoned and its yaw counted through the fault (fault_track), and
the car is held to its speed while faulted (hold_v), as on a handback. So is a curb-side turn in hand (below). A faulted plan carries the
scene's limits (live pedestrians, or those carried through a detector gap, and the junction hold in force where it
was; scene_policy.py), which plannerd acts on (hooks.limits_plan), so a turnpilotd failing every frame still never
drives the car on through a pedestrian. Its desire and lane change are never acted on.
Once the detector is back and TurnPilot acts again, the dropped maneuver is taken up or skipped out loud, never left
half driven (_take_up_dropped).
A curb-side turn (a right where traffic keeps right) is committed only at its one pulse 8 m out (desire_timing.py,
2026-11-06); at HEAD its 40 m pulse had it committed from there, and what hung off that commitment left the right unguarded
from its cap's lead to 8 m (the 2026-11-06 reviews). So from turn_speed.TURN_CAP_LEAD_M in to its junction (by the nearest
reading: past it an unpulsed turn gets no pulse), a curb-side TURN TurnPilot acts on, not dropped at a
handback, not skipped, not the stop-sign ladder's other turn's, its desire not done, is IN HAND
(in_hand_now; hand_id, by last frame's state as turn_committed is), and gets HEAD's protections for it (Kellen, 2026-11-06:
HEAD parity): the follower holds it through gaps in the route as a committed turn (route_follower.py: junction_hold, but a
new route that doesn't turn there is taken and a short outlier still re-baselines it); a fault keeps it (its route and its
desire state, dead-reckoned, the car held to its speed) as a committed turn; a handback keeps its corner cap; section 4.5's
unstick never lifts a model stand within STOPPED_CONTROL_M of it (at its line: an unmapped red, a walker the detector doesn't
score, its crosswalk at the corner), as none did with its desire out; and any skip of it but too fast (tooLate, a signal or
walker veto at its hold line, braking to it, at rest behind a lead, its lane unreachable, a signal its take-up can't stop for)
keeps its corner cap to the pass, so the car never speeds from 3 to 7.5 m/s straight through the junction it was slowing to
turn at (tests-signal probe1: from its walker hold line 8.26 m out). A too-fast skip keeps none (turn_skip.py: no hard braking
for a turn). A skip is still decided as for any turn not committed (a veto while rolling skips it, where a committed turn
goes on: no desire is in the model's queue to cancel), and turn_skip still judges it (tooFast, its deadline, its crossing).
The follower moving off it for another maneuver of the same route while the car is short of it is never silent
(check_hand_dropped: turnMissed, navd reroutes).
Never in silence either (2026-11-06, the lifecycle follow-ups): a started curb-side turn whose re-engage repeat DesireTiming
refuses past its first pulse's bounds is skipped out loud (say_refused_repeat: desireDropped, its pulse cleared, its cap kept),
but for a blip (a fault frame, a frame or three of latActive gone) or a car turning on its first pulse already, which that pulse
drives on with nothing said or cleared (desire_timing REPEAT_BLIP_FRAMES);
a route turn at a signal is never skipped nor handed back for a light nobody read (2026-11-07: no stop for want of a green,
so neither signal_turn_late's skip and "Light too close to stop for: take control" nor the take-up's signalStop skip, which
stood on it, is left; a red or yellow read is the light's own stop); the stop-sign ladder's other curb-side turn not pulsed by its
deadline is handed back with no hold in the junction (alt_turn_late); a curb-side turn skipped tooLate that the car then turns
TURN_STARTED_DEG into is the model's own again, its cap and crosswalk hold back (adopt_skipped); a turn's skip is carried to a
new route's id at the same junction, one skip per junction, its cap kept through the reroute's gap (carry_skip, skipped_cap),
the same junction by its readings' span at the reroute turn's first sight, never the next right on (SKIP_SAME_M);
a curb-side turn's go from further out than its pulse runs the no-move clock with the switch off too (curb_release); navd's
route waiting on its start direction is said as starting, not off route (route_starting).
No gas go anywhere (Kellen, 2026-10-28; DESIGN phase 4, G1): any gas press disengages (DisengageOnAccelerator, on by
default; preflight fails without it, and TurnPilot faults while it is off: Fault.disengageOnAccelerator), which is the
driver taking over, never TurnPilot's go. A gas press with openpilot disengaged (the driver driving) is what releases the
scene's junction hold at its line (scene_policy.py).
A turn the car pulls away into from a standstill (a hold's go, the turn's pulse in that frame) is unverified: in BeamNG it
was taken about half the time (2026-10-28). A curb-side turn whose one pulse waits for 8 m (desire_timing) let go from a line
further out than that is such a go too, its bookkeeping armed at its first pulse (watch_curb_go). Past its junction (the
follower's pass) having turned under MISSED_TURN_DEG, its desire not cleared at the turn's angle (a turn under 20 deg clears
under MISSED_TURN_DEG, and that one was taken), it was missed: turnMissed for MISSED_HOLD_S, which selfdrived chimes as a
skip ("Turn Missed", "Rerouting") and on which navd reroutes at once. Nothing brakes for it. Standing more than
STALL_PROMPT_S in any route turn in progress (its desire out and not done; after a go of TurnPilot's for it, done or not),
STALL_MIN_DEG to STALL_MAX_DEG into it (from its start, after a go of TurnPilot's that came in the junction), whoever
stopped the car (TurnPilot's go, or the model on its own: BUILD_FINDINGS D2; under STALL_MIN_DEG too once past the
maneuver point, where a red's stop line never is), with no hold of TurnPilot's and no lead within STOPPED_LEAD_M that the live scene corroborates
(watch_lead: a vehicle track or box at it; one it corroborates holds the car LEAD_STAND_MAX_S at most), it stalled in the
junction: handed back loudly (controlPrompt stalledTakeControl, STALLED_REASON), never held there, and TurnPilot never
goes itself. Moving in such a turn past its hold
line, under half of it turned, the model steering away from it (modelV2.action.desiredCurvature, TURN_ABANDON_S) is a turn
abandoned (BUILD_FINDINGS N1): handed back loudly (turnAbandonedTakeControl) until the driver takes over, nothing steered
or held, the turn's caps kept.
Right-hand traffic, engaged and moving, a yellow line read on the car's right (the lane paint: under US markings the car is
left of the centre line; BUILD_FINDINGS D5-lane, the model keeping to the oncoming lane after wide turns) for WRONG_SIDE_S
of reads is the wrong side of the road: handed back loudly (wrongSideTakeControl) until the driver takes over, nothing
steered or held.
From the go such a turn is driven under its post-go profile (turn_speed.py: PostGo; DESIGN phase 4 section 3): accel and
speed capped by the heading it has turned, DesireTiming.turned_deg at the go and the car's yaw after, until 60 deg or
POST_GO_MAX_M on, and dropped at the pass of a turn missed straight on. TurnPilotPostGoProfile names the profile
(graduated by default; none, flat3, flat43 for the BeamNG sweep), and an unprotected turn's go (unprotected_turn: a left
across the oncoming road) takes TurnPilotLeftGoProfile's (left: 1.5 m/s^2, 4.3 m/s). The caps only lower speed.
A go from the hold line (go_at_line: the car GO_LINE_M or more before the maneuver point, the scene not committed to the
junction nor released into it) the car hasn't pulled away on (STANDSTILL_SPEED) within NO_MOVE_S (TurnPilotNoMoveS, up to
NO_MOVE_MAX_S, for the sweep), LEFT_NO_MOVE_S for an unprotected turn (CRITIQUE
REQUIRED 4: its gap runs out while it stands), counting only while nothing else holds it (no TurnPilot hold, no close lead
the scene corroborates, NO_MOVE_MAX_S from the go at most behind one, no pedal), is the model holding the car: TurnPilot
withdraws the go before the car moves, holding it standing (shouldStop, a 0 speed cap: braking at -2.0 at most, from
under 0.3 m/s; no turn pulse), and hands back loudly (controlPrompt cantStartTakeControl, NO_MOVE_REASON) until the
driver takes over (openpilot disengaged: any gas press); a scene hold that comes and goes meanwhile (a walker crossing)
is no new go. The turn isn't cancelled: its desire state stays, and the
driver drives it. A go in the junction (a walker's hold released partway round) is never withdrawn: stopping there is worse
than finishing the turn, so TurnPilot never holds the car in it; it keeps the post-go caps, which only lower speed, and the
stall's handback without a hold.
The route's unprotected left (map_controls.unprotected_turn) is driven by unprotected_left.py (DESIGN phase 4 G4) under
TurnPilotAutoLeft: auto (the default: Kellen, 2026-10-28, "No it has to ship taking the turn"), announce or off (G1's
handback at the line). Each frame it is fed the hold line's latch and the scene from the last frame, this frame's raw
detector run (main(): SceneTracker.raw), the car's yaw toward the turn (track_yaw) and the opposing road's mapped speed and
lanes, and checked at its line against TurnPilotLeftRangeM (the detector's proven range; unset: unmeasured, ROAD_RANGE_M 0),
the full pass's never past FULL_PASS_RANGE_M (what the letterboxed pass can box: left_ranges; past it the band is the far
slot's, the native schedule's at TurnPilotLeftRangeM or the far crop's measured range; capped after dark to NIGHT_LEFT_RANGE_M
until 2026-11-07, only a logged label since: no night-only gating). Every left is driven to its line, never skipped or
rerouted for its range (Kellen, 2026-11-06) nor its lane (LC-03's verdict: wrongLane, 2026-11-07): there it goes on a gap the
camera can certify on the band it covers, or waits saying why; only a fault hands back, loudly, the car held. Its command goes to
the latch (map_controls.LeftCommand: hold, creep, go, or a fault's handback), its own hold after a withdrawn go joins the
scene's stops, and no turn pulse goes on its approach (may_start off; turn_skip's pulse_at_go): its go from the line is the
first. It asks modeld for the road camera (turnpilotPlan.detectorView) and publishes its state (unprotectedLeft); its wait
is silent (waitingForGap, creepingForView), its go a chime, and it hands back (leftUndecidedTakeControl) only for a fault.
Its reach past the full pass's range is the far crop's (DESIGN phase 4 G5): modeld's far crop runs (main(): SceneTracker.raw_far)
are fed to it with TurnPilotLeftFarRangeM (the far crop's proven range; unset: unmeasured, 0) while the full pass's latest
farStatus says it reads (watch_far), at route time too; turnpilotPlan.farCropBearing aims it up the oncoming approach while
the left is in hand (unprotected_left.far_aim), else straight ahead. The far crop going off for the drive (farStatus
disabled) is said once (controlAlert farViewOff, a status line) and logged; a left needing it then hands back (farOff).
Its class-9 heads are logged in shadow only (turnpilot.far_light_shadow), never acted on.
With TurnPilotFarPeds on (off by default), main() runs tracker B beside tracker A (scene/tracker_b.py): the same runs, and the
far crop's people starting tracks of its own. Its pedestrians tracker A doesn't hold reach the scene policy alone, as objects
that never confirm: a "pedestrian in path" stop on the comfortable curve at most. turnpilotScene and everything else here are A's.
Its go is TurnPilot's like any hold's: the left's post-go profile and LEFT_NO_MOVE_S below.
TurnPilot's go from a standstill (any of the above: a turn its hold let go of, at the line or in the junction, or the left's)
is certified for plannerd's bounded lift (go_override.py; DESIGN phase 4 decision 1, G5) under TurnPilotGoOverride (on by
default): turnpilotPlan.goCertified, cause turnRelease or unprotectedLeft, asserted on every frame of the go. Not while the
driver is on a pedal or disengaged, the scene isn't live, a hold of TurnPilot's is in force, the model has a lead within
GO_CLEAR_M, or a road user is in the path within it (path_blocker: a track, or a raw box of this frame's run); any of them
coming during the go, TurnPilot handing back, or the left withdrawing its own go withdraws it that frame (withdraw_go), and
it ends on its own at GO_WINDOW_S, GO_END_SPEED or the model's takeover (go_override.GoCertifier). plannerd then lifts the
model's hold, +0.5 m/s^2 at most, while the model alone holds the car. A turnRelease rests on its junction's own
certification, as the left's go rests on its gap: the junction's signal read green by an accepted source, never the
camera's shadow green (release_blocked, RELEASE_UNSIGNALIZED; skeptic G5: a walker clearing at a red the model alone held
for had the lift roll the car into the junction), so on the car this week none. The left's lift needs the same of its light
where a signal is (a green from an accepted source; skeptic G5 residual: the camera's shadow green certified it and the lift
rolled the car through the model's red), so on the car this week a signalized left gets no lift, only an unsignalized one;
a red or yellow any source reads at the junction, mapped or not, keeps either off. Never for a turn across the oncoming road
(its go is the left's) nor for a far-side turn released in the junction (a committed left lifted into the oncoming lane as
an oncoming car closed: nothing the lift checks sees those lanes; the stall's handback covers that stand). Uncertified (the
param off, a blocker, no green), the go is as before: the model pulls away, or the no-move handback below comes. The left's
go is lifted only from LEFT_LIFT_ROOM_M or more short of the oncoming lanes (its line, not a creep), and is followed into
them only by a launch (unprotected_left.LEFT_LAUNCH_SPEED, left_launch_armed): short of it with LEFT_LAUNCH_ROOM_M left to
stop short of them it is judged again for the launch the car shows, as the go is (on the band the camera covers out to that
launch's R_req): kept driving where nothing is seen there, withdrawn to the left's own wait short of them where a car is,
never a handback (review 2026-11-07, L3: withdrawn and handed back until then). Kept driving and committed short of
LEFT_LAUNCH_SPEED, a lifted left is carried across them (left_carry: a go of its own, go_override's carry, the lift to the
left's post-go profile and never past it; review 2026-11-08: a coast on the lift's 0.78 m/s spent about 15 s in them).
Standing engaged with nothing of TurnPilot's holding the car (no shouldStop, no cap biting), no lead from the model within
STOPPED_LEAD_M that the live scene corroborates (one further on doesn't hold a standing car, nor one nothing in the scene
shows: a phantom, a mailbox), gas and brake off, the model stopped on its own: said, with one info chime a stand (carStoppedNote; none
within STOPPED_CONTROL_M of a mapped signal, where the model stands at every red), on the
status line after STOPPED_NOTE_S (STOPPED_NOTE), and handed back loudly (controlPrompt carStoppedTakeControl) after
STOPPED_HANDBACK_S, or NEAR_CONTROL_STAND_S with a map control within STOPPED_CONTROL_M (CRITIQUE REQUIRED 6: a model
stall at a mapped signal TurnPilot doesn't hold for is never silent, and a red the map doesn't know, the car first in
line, isn't handed back before it can turn green); under TurnPilotAlwaysDrive at a mapped signal never handed back since
2026-11-07, the model's wait for the light said however long (LIGHT_WAIT_NOTE's comment). TurnPilot never goes itself; the driver taking over (a gas press
disengages) starts the wait over.
A person TurnPilot saw who may still be in front (WARGAME_FIXES WF-13, BeamNG SAT validation row 6; scene_policy.person_front: a
pedestrian track whose stop brought the car to rest, or a confirmed one, lost within PERSON_FRONT_X_M ahead in or near the path
with the car at 2 m/s or slower): the scene's stop holds the car standing, or brings it to rest on the comfortable curve, and
"Person may be in front" is the status line from that frame. Every go of TurnPilot's is barred on it (go_blocked: 'personFront',
so S2's releases and relifts, the unstick and clearBox lifts and the stop-sign decider's certified go; the decider's own go
through its front zone, the left's through its scene_clear). It ends on the driver (openpilot disengaged, or the gas) or once
she is seen again where she was lost and seen walking clear of the corridor (someone else crossing in front is not her), then
nothing person-like in front 2 s; PERSON_FRONT_MAX_S on it is handed back loudly (personFrontTakeControl, PERSON_FRONT_REASON)
with the car still held. TurnPilotAlwaysDrive changes none of it.
A lane change a map stop leaves no room for, before it or after its go, with the map's lane list placing the car in a lane
the maneuver doesn't leave from (lane_planner.py: unreachable), skips the maneuver as too fast to turn does: said
(turnpilotTooFastToTurn, "Can't Reach Turn Lane" by laneChangeWait unreachable) and rerouted, unless its desire went out.
A handback or a fault cancels a lane change that is offered and not yet started, with laneChangeAbort handedBack or
fault for ABORT_HOLD_S (selfdrived raises turnpilotLaneChangeAborted); TurnPilot turned off cancels it as turnedOff.
A change DesireHelper has started goes on, and one it may have started on the request already isn't announced as
aborted (lane_planner.LanePlanner._abort).
Alert priority (hooks.plan_events): handback, then fault (turnpilotUnavailable), then too fast to turn, then a lane
change, then wrong lane. While TurnPilot isn't acting or is faulted, too fast to turn, wrong lane and lane change offers
are never set here; the rest of the order is selfdrived's (hooks.plan_events, hooks.lane_change_events).

    same way there again is a new maneuver id (route_follower: a new route, the turn not committed after the veto's cancel),
    and taken up fresh it would be prompted, signalled and taken, with our lamp put out by nothing that could veto it again.
    A keep is one too: the intent signals and vetoes a TURN or a KEEP (car_signals: signals_turn), and every 'slight'
    modifier is a keep (a city Y junction's slight right, a fork, an off ramp). The same junction: same_junction (type,
    modifier, bearings when both have them) and within SAME_TURN_M of where the veto put it on the odometer; skipped for the

    SAME_TURN_M past it. Before this frame's TurnSkip.update, which then keeps it.
    A veto at the unprotected left's line (v.line) is the left's handback there, never a skip (a skip lets go of the latch
    with the car in a left-turn position, 6.6's exception), and it ended the request for the left. Carried, that request
    stays ended under the new id (TurnSignalIntent.end: never armed, signalled, prompted or handed over), before this frame's
    intent update, so the car never relights the left the driver overruled, never prompts 'Signal Left' for it with our
    lamp put out, and a takeover never asks for it. It is for the left at the line the car stands at: carried only to a left
    within LINE_VETO_SAME_M of where the veto put it (the readings' spread, never the next left on), and forgotten
    once the car is past that junction (the driver took over and drove it): a left of a new id after it, which without
    junction data same_junction can't tell from it, would otherwise lose its lamp and prompt with nothing said. Past it
    takes both: beyond where the veto put the junction, and LINE_VETO_MOVED_M on from where the veto found the car. The
    junction's place is the follower's nearest reading, which only runs down, so one reading off nearer while the car

    about 15 s where R_req assumed under 3, so a car outside the camera's band at the go could arrive while the car was still
    in them. Only the left's lifted go (go_lifted: one plannerd wouldn't lift, at a signal on the car, crosses with the
    model), certified once a go, through go_refused's checks but the lift's room (the car is past where its nudge mattered:
    committed), its post-go profile in force, once the go from its line is over, however that go ended (review 2026-11-08: a
    go withdrawn before the model's takeover, a one-frame lead, left no_move's clock running and the carry never came, 21.8
    s in the lanes, nothing said); withdrawn across the lanes (R_req's path, CLEAR_PATH_PAST_M past the maneuver point,
    however far the car has turned: the profile's own 1.5 m/s^2 and 4.3 m/s past its 45 deg, under the corner's cap), turned
    to its angle (DesireTiming's done: on the exit road), the turn missed or skipped, or the left no longer committed
    (withdraw_go's rails every frame besides). Withdrawn by one of those rails that this gate checks again every frame (a
    lead, a road user in the path, a hold, the scene, a person, the light), it is certified again, a go of its own, once that
    rail clears (review 2026-11-08: a 0.5 s phantom lead at the commit withdrew it on its first frame and the car crawled 14
    s in the lanes); never after the driver, a handback or its own ends. Its plannerd ends (the model slowing, braking or
    stopping, a lead only the radar sees) never withdraw it here, so they stay for good: the same go, its lift over. A carry
    the commit asked for and that doesn't come is said, each reason once a go (left_carry_refused: why), but for the go from
    the line still out (its own end, GO_WINDOW_S at most) or the car at CARRY_SPEED by itself. Never steering; a car seen in
    the band before the commit still withdraws the go while the car can stop (unprotected_left: _after_go)."""

    After TurnPilot's go its desire may be done already (DesireTiming clears a turn at max(angle - CLEAR_MARGIN_DEG,

    A route turn R8b's fire cleared under TurnPilotAlwaysDrive (straight_fired, to the follower's pass) is the stall's as a

    road's far lanes the deadline is for); DesireTiming now bounds that re-engage repeat as the first pulse is, with or without
    a handback, and say_refused_repeat skips it out loud where it refuses (desireDropped). A turn at a signal is taken up as
    any other (Kellen, 2026-11-07: test builds act on what they see; a safety driver on every drive): with no colour read the
    turn goes with the model, as a through signal does (map_controls: no stop for want of a green since 2026-11-07), and a red
    or yellow read there is the light's own stop. Until then one whose stop at its line couldn't be made at MAP_DECEL_MAX with
    no green read (signal_stop_lost) was skipped out loud here (signalStop, "Can't Stop for the Light"), a premise gone with
