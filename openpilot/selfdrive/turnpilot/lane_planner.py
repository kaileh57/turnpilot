"""Lane planner: get into the lane a turn leaves from, one nav lane change at a time, each warned of, confirmed and
checked until it starts.

Which lane the car is in comes from what the model sees: lanes either side counted from the room between the
ego lane's line and the road edge, at about 3.6 m a lane, but only where the next line out is painted (room
alone counts shoulders and parking strips as lanes). modelV2 can't tell a yellow line from a white one, and on
an undivided road its far road edge lies beyond the oncoming lanes; the lane paint read off the road camera
(scene/lane_paint.py, one entry per modelV2 lane line) can. US markings say what is beyond a line: broken white
is a lane going the same way, solid white an edge, shoulder, bike or parking lane, yellow oncoming traffic or a
divided road's left edge.

Where to go (desired_changes): with the map's lane list (NavInstruction.lanes) the car's lane is counted from the curb
side, which is always its own direction's, and lanes beyond a yellow line count 0. That count is known only where the model
can make it: a curb lane often has no edge line, and one lane in from it the model sees room for a lane but no line, so it
can't tell the curb lane from the one beside it. The changes made for the maneuver are counted too (LanePlanner.done), and
the lane dead reckoned from where the first of them started: no more changes than the lane list needs from there, and none
from a lane it can't place. A change is counted only once the model's lines show the car got over (LineWatch), or its lane
counts moved over: DesireHelper ends a change the same way whether or not it did. One that ends without, or a line crossed
with no change of DesireHelper's (openpilot off, a manual change), leaves the lane unknown, and a lane the model places is
never overridden by the count (nav_lane_span). A lane it can't place is said out loud (lane_unknown:
turnpilotPlan.laneMismatch laneUnknown) instead of changed from. On the far side from the curb only the list's own lanes
are lanes (nav_room): on an undivided road the model's far road edge lies
beyond the oncoming lanes (BeamNG, 2026-10-27: a second change left across a double yellow into the oncoming lane). Without it (the usual case: OSM tags
lanes on few roads) an exit moves toward the curb by the model's lane count, but not across a curb-side line read solid
white, and a turn, or an exit away from the curb, moves one lane toward its side at a time, looked at again after each
change.

Whether the next change may go (change_blocker), on every path, map lanes or not: only into a valid travel lane, which
means all of
- the ego line that way reads broken white at BROKEN_WHITE_CONF_MIN or better: solid, yellow, no line, unknown, or no
  paint read at all (no detector, the wide camera, a stale scene) is no change. A yellow read keeps vetoing for
  YELLOW_HOLD_S and YELLOW_HOLD_M after the last one, so a worn stretch doesn't open a gap; the hold moves with the lines
  in a lane change, and covers all four lines when the direction of one is unknown;
- the model sees a lane that way, its next line out at least LANE_MIN lane widths beyond the ego line (an 8 ft parking
  strip beside an 11 ft lane is 0.73, a 6 ft bike lane beside a 10 ft one 0.61), not beyond a yellow line;
- nothing stopped in that lane ahead (parked cars: a parking strip);
- under US markings (MUTCD) only: in left-hand traffic the center line is broken white, so nothing goes away from the curb
  there, and nothing tells right-hand Europe (white center lines too) from the US.
Before the paint, a change toward the curb before a junction turn put the car in a parking strip (BeamNG, 2026-10-27).

How a change goes (LanePlanner): once the same change is wanted for LC_CONFIRM_FRAMES, the driver is warned LC_WARN_S
ahead: laneChangeOffer says the side (selfdrived raises turnpilotLaneChangeLeft/Right, a chime) and laneChangeCountdown the
seconds left. On cars where openpilot can't signal (the Tesla: opendbc has no blinker command), the driver's stalk is the
go-ahead, at any point in the countdown or up to LC_SIGNAL_TIMEOUT_S after it; elsewhere the request goes when the
countdown ends. The request stands in for the nudge (and, where openpilot signals, the blinker) and DesireHelper still
waits for the car's own blind spot signal (Tesla DAS_status). Until DesireHelper starts the change, every frame checks it
again, and any failure aborts it, with laneChangeAbort saying why for ABORT_HOLD_S (selfdrived raises
turnpilotLaneChangeAborted): the line no longer broken white or the lane no longer valid, the blind spot occupied, a car in
the target lane, no signal in time (or the blinker off before the change started), the route changed, the change no
longer needed, the car too slow or too close to the maneuver, DesireHelper waiting too long. Once the change has started
nothing cancels it: the car is already moving over. A change the driver makes alone gets the same cooldown before the next
offer, for the lines to settle. TurnPilotLanePaintActive off plans no change at all; turnpilotd then publishes what this
would have asked for in laneChangePaintRule.

A map stop between the car and the maneuver (stop_d: MapControlPolicy.stop_ahead) inside the window (BeamNG lane_change on
the signal tiles, 2026-10-28: a signal 164 m before the turn, and braking for it kept the car under DesireHelper's speed
minimum from 227 m in, so no change was offered). Its braking curve takes the car under that minimum slow_zone(v) before
it, so no change starts there (the window's end moves out to it), and the window opens early enough before that for the
offer, its warning and DesireHelper's start (LC_PRE_LEAD_S). With less room than LC_OFFER_ROOM_S at speed before the slow
zone, the change goes after the stop's go when the road from the stop to the window's end can take the car up to speed
and through an offer (AFTER_GO_M): wait afterStop until then. With neither, the lane is unreachable: said (wait
unreachable, and the reason), and where the map's lane list places the car in a lane the maneuver doesn't leave from,
LaneDecision.unreachable: turnpilotd skips the maneuver by the too-fast rules (turn_skip.py: out loud, navd reroutes),
never a turn from the wrong lane or a change too late. Every frame LaneDecision.wait says why a change the route wants
isn't offered (turnpilotPlan.laneChangeWait), and want how many it wants (laneChangeWant), whatever the car's speed.
