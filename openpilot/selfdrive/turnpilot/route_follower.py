"""Route following: the next maneuver and the distance to it, between navd's 1 Hz updates.

navd publishes navInstruction once a second: maneuverDistance is the distance to the end of the current step,
and it runs down to about -10 m before navd advances to the next step. Between updates the distance is
dead-reckoned from carState.vEgo, which at highway speed is up to 30 m better than the last message.
Maneuver type and modifier are Mapbox/OSRM strings, copied through by navd unchanged.
What counts as a turn: only a junction maneuver, where the route leaves the road at an intersection that other roads
meet (navInstruction.maneuverBranches > 0, from Valhalla's intersection bearings). Where the road just bends and no
other road meets it, the maneuver is NONE: the driving model follows the bend (0.11.3's Autospeed slows for curves), and
TurnPilot sends no desire and no speed cap there. navd moves past such a step only 10 m beyond its end, so the turn or
keep after it (RouteFollower.ahead, from allManeuvers with its junction) is looked ahead to for its speed cap: a junction
turn 30-50 m past a bend was otherwise seen at road speed, too late to slow for, and skipped. Its desire waits until the
car is past the step: a turn desire before a straight-on junction would turn the car there. That is when the step is
dead-reckoned NAVD_ADVANCE_M past, where navd moves on, not up to a second later at navd's next update: the turn after
it becomes the maneuver then, under its own id, which navd's update moving on to it keeps (an update still on the step
only brings the turn's distance). Even so a turn under turn_skip.MIN_FIRST_PULSE_M past the step is skipped out loud.
The angle is the real one, bearing_after less bearing_before. A route
without intersection data (maneuverGeometryValid false; Valhalla always has it) leaves every turn a junction at the
modifier's nominal angle, which is logged once per maneuver and shown in the plan's reason.
A new route (a destination set from the phone, a reroute) can start with a maneuver of the same type and modifier as
the old one, so it is told apart by navd marking it (one invalid navInstruction between the two routes, and a new
routeCount) or by the distance jumping up by more than GPS noise or dead reckoning explain. Either way the old maneuver
was dropped, not passed, and RouteFollower.replaced says so for the one update: its turn pulse must not carry over to the
new route.
Where a junction is: no navd reading of it is trusted over another, however many agree. GPS bias lasts (urban multipath
over a long approach, a fix off while the car stands in a queue, a reroute's snap), and every rule that let readings
outvote each other let a biased track win somewhere and lifted a committed turn's cap short of its junction. So every
reading of the maneuver's junction from JunctionSpan.FROM_M in is dead-reckoned on (JunctionSpan), and what is done
with them holds whichever one is right:
- RouteFollower.distance, and with it the turn's cap, its desire's lead and an unprotected turn's hold line, is the
  NEAREST of them: slow early, never late. A jump up is never taken up for it, so it only ever runs down. Where the
  furthest is more than UNCERTAIN_M beyond it while a committed unprotected turn's hold is ahead, turnpilotd says so out
  loud (controlAlert junctionUncertain) rather than guess, and a hold line read behind where the car can stop at the
  floor stops the car as soon as it can (map_controls.py);
- the maneuver counts as passed (its cap lifted, its id bumped, CLEAR sent) on navd's distance only once the car is
  dead-reckoned PASSED_DIST_M past the FURTHEST of them, never on a vote. The car having turned it is the other evidence
  (DesireTiming clears it at its angle).
A committed turn (turnpilotd: its turn desire is out) is never dropped that way (Kellen: never cancel a turn once
committed, and a car slowing for a turn must not speed up into it). The junction is where it was whatever navd says:
- an invalid navInstruction for the same route (navd off the step for a fix, rerouting, the destination removed) or navd
  going quiet past NAV_STALE_S is a gap: the maneuver stays, dead-reckoned, under the same id, until navd's next valid
  update carries on with it or the turn is over (cleared at its angle, or dead-reckoned PASSED_DIST_M past the furthest
  of its readings);
- navd on another step (not same_junction) is a gap too, however close in: navd moving on early to the next step (a
  sharp turn's, up to 10 m before its end, or a GPS jump forward) doesn't mean the car has made the turn. It is over
  only on real evidence: the car has turned it (DesireTiming clears it at its angle) or is dead-reckoned PASSED_DIST_M
  past the furthest of its readings. Until then its id and its cap stay and no CLEAR goes; navd's next update after that takes up the next step;
- a jump in the distance to the same junction, up or down, is GPS noise: one more reading of it (above), however close
  in, and a reroute's readings too. One more than SAME_TURN_M outside its readings so far is navd on another junction (a
  GPS jump, navd moving on early to the next turn the same way on a route without bearings): a gap, as above;
- a new route (a new routeCount) whose first maneuver is the same junction (same_junction) within SAME_TURN_M of the
  dead-reckoned one is the same maneuver (a reroute onto the road the car is on, its origin snapped up to a reroute's
  25 m off), its readings one more of the junction's. A new route that doesn't turn there (a reroute whose origin snapped past
  the junction, a destination changed from the phone) is a gap: the turn is held to its end, and the new route taken up
  after.
After a reroute or a jump navd's distance to the junction can stay off by that much: the turn's cap would lift, or the
turn read as passed, before the car gets there. So from then on that junction is held, while the turn is committed and
after it while navd is still on its step (by its bearings), and never taken up again as a new maneuver.
