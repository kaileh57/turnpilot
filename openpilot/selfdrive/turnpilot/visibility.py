"""The live reach of STOP_SIGNS.md 1.4 (SG3b): per conflicting lane of the held control's junction, how far down it the camera
sees now, through stop_rules' walk with the live inputs. Nothing reads it to act yet (SG4a's decider will); turnpilotd logs it.

LiveVisibility is fed every detector run turnpilotd drains (observe_run: its view, camera time, raw boxes and, on a side
view's run, its sectors' quality) and, each frame, whether the scene is available (set_available: the tracker's staleness on
turnpilotd's clock, so a detector that stops leaves nothing fresh). lanes() then walks each lane with:

- Freshness on camera time: a view counts while its newest run is within DET_FRESH_S of the newest run of any view, that
  newest run's own age since it arrived (turnpilotd's clock: a whole detector stall) added (the side view on the lane's side
  for 'side'), and only while the scene is available.
- Sector quality over the whole CLEAR_S window, not only the latest frame: a side-view bearing counts only if every run of
  that side's view in the window listed an ok sector covering it, at the point's bearing and at it unrotated (a run without a
  reading counts as not ok). The inner band (40 deg to the side views' inner edge) also needs the innermost sector ok.
- The sun: with the sun ahead and the veil present or unmeasured, 67 deg to the edge on both sides (sunAhead); low sun along
  an approach, that side's side-view sectors (lowSun); night and dusk have no table, so nothing.
- The footprint mask from visibility.json (stop_rules.footprint_ok, a car-sized footprint, not a ground point); a file
  without a mask (before step S1) sees nothing (noMask): a missing mask never leaves the pillar and housing at full reach.
  Under TurnPilotStopSignGo=vision (lanes(vision=True)) the walk runs without it, on the optimistic row, with no survey,
  stamp or rule 5: the side views' sector quality stands in for the mask, and a pillar or housing that cuts the footprint
  above or below the horizon band is the residual vision accepts (STOP_SIGNS.md 7.2 residual 4).
- Occluders from every track, moving or not, and from every raw box held steady (STEADY_S with STEADY_SAMPLES runs of its
  view, bearing within STEADY_BEARING_DEG, width within STEADY_WIDTH): its bearing span caps each lane where it meets the
  lane at sLaneMin (a stopped car caps its own lane at itself and every lane behind it). A track's or box's ground range is
  trusted only under OCCLUDER_RANGE_TRUST_DEG, and then at its near end (OCCLUDER_NEAR_FRAC); past it, or unranged, it is
  bearing-only (1.2: an occluder whose depth is unknown).
- At a surveyed junction, the survey's sight distance and the parking on the lane's binding curb (routing.certify.lane_cap),
  and a passing validation stamp's minFirstTrackM in place of the tables' range bound (never in place of the coverage).
- A lane whose approach doesn't stop (section 4.1) has reach 0 (notSurveyed) unless the survey has that approach's sight
  distance (1.4 rule 5, row G2): YOLO reports cars, not hedges, fences, walls or crests, so with no survey nothing says the
  lane isn't hidden, whatever the tables' walk would reach (an unsurveyed junction's opposite lane read 127.5 m).

Per lane: reach, R_seen = reach - v_c T_LAT, the binding limit (what ended the walk), its need (all-way or two-way), the raw
boxes that block it (confidence RAW_BLOCK_CONF or more, not steady, whose bearing ray meets it within its need at either end
of the s band, or any within RAW_HORIZON_DEG of the horizon on its side: blockers()), and its shield candidates from stop_evidence (a
vehicle stopped at its line) and qualified shields. Besides, the near edge estimated from cross cars' forward distance at
bearings under EDGE_EST_MAX_DEG, which is logged and read by nothing (ground range there is unvalidated until step S4).
