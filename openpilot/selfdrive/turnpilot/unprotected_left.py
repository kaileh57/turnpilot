"""The autonomous unprotected left (DESIGN phase 4 section 2, G4; CRITIQUE REQUIRED 2-5): a routed turn across the oncoming
traffic of the road ahead (map_controls.unprotected_turn), taken from its hold line with no gas tap.

Kellen, 2026-10-28: "No it has to ship taking the turn", and for this version no intervention. So while the car can judge
the junction it waits at the hold line for a gap it can certify, as a careful driver does, for as long as it takes, the car
held, never let go and never handed back for the wait (Kellen, 2026-11-07: "no, no handbacks"; test builds are "bleeding
edge, not maximal caution", a safety driver on every drive). A handback (UNDECIDED: leftUndecidedTakeControl, the handback
chime, the car held) is only for a fault: road camera frames stale, the junction's position unknown, the driver's lamp the
other way (driverSignal). The car standing yawed past what the road camera frames of the band (YAW_VIEW_DEG, after a
withdrawn go) is judged at its measured heading on what it does frame, said once with a chime (turnpilot.left_yaw_view,
LONG_WAIT_REASON['yaw']): the 'yaw' handback until 2026-11-08. Until 2026-11-07 the waits ended in one too,
the car held: no gap in STAND_UNDECIDED_S (noGap; standing where the tracker says something stands in the band or the exit
zones; DESIGN's UNDECIDED row, owner decision (ii), 2026-10-30), the far crop's boxes alone for FAR_BLOCKED_UNDECIDED_S
(farBlocked), the view still blocked BLOCKED_UNDECIDED_S after the full creep (blocked), a creep not made in CREEP_STALL_S
(creepStall), no lamp on its side for LEFT_SIGNAL_WAIT_S (unsignalled), the light read unknown LIGHT_UNKNOWN_S or red past
LIGHT_RED_MAX_S (light), and a red or yellow read after it stood on a green (lightChange). Each is now a wait at the line,
logged once a wait as its old bound passes (_said: turnpilot.left_no_gap, left_far_wait, left_view_wait, left_unsignalled,
left_light_wait, left_light_changed) with its status line saying what the car waits for (LONG_WAIT_REASON), a car the
detector sees still holding the left. Never an endless silent wait (skeptic g4c: 240 s on 'waitingForGap' alone): the
line says why, the log has it once, and the safety driver supervises.
A missing frame is never clear. Never a handback for what the camera can't see (Kellen, 2026-11-07: "no, no handbacks. that
kinda thing is for the final public build, we just NEED to be ready to test"; a safety driver supervises every drive): an
R_req past the camera's reach, by day or after dark, or past where the opposing road bends out of the band, is judged on the
band the camera covers (out to the smaller of its reach, R_req and the straight run), a car seen there holding the left. A
left in a lane it doesn't leave from (LC-03) is skipped out loud and rerouted by turnpilotd (Kellen, 2026-11-08, drive 29:
never taken across a lane from the wrong one; driven from the lane it was in from 2026-11-07, LN-5), but for one LC-03
flags only once the car stands held at its line (wrong_lane, crossed_lanes, a car beside holding it: LS-1, LEFTS-2).
At a mapped signal the hold is in the junction's mouth (map_controls.SIGNAL_LEFT_HOLD_M, LeftInput.line_m; drive 29: every
left at a green ball was held 9 m short, the driver driving them all): the approach is the model's, the signal's own control
stops the car at its line for a red or yellow read, and on a green, read or not, the car rolls up to the mouth and the gap
rule judges the oncoming lanes from there. Its stop line is behind it there, so a red read while it waits is a red in the
junction (LS-4's words), and the car clears the junction on its gap (2026-11-08). turnpilot.left_reach logs, once per hold at
the line, how far that band reached against R_req and what it fell short for. The paragraphs below that say 'hands back'
for range, night or curve describe the build before.

TurnPilotAutoLeft (turnpilotd) picks the mode: auto (the default), announce (the car stops at the hold line and says
whether it would go, then hands back as before: debugging only), or off (the hold line's handback, G1's).

States: approach (no turn pulse before the hold, so the car stands straight with the road camera up the oncoming
approach), waitGap (held at the line), creep (for a view), go, committed, undecided; announce in that mode.
The rolling go (ROLLING_GO, roll_why): on the approach, a band clear for the whole window by the point where the stop for the
line would take the car under its corner's speed is gone without that stop. The go is asked of the line's stop one frame
(LeftDecision.go, state still approach) and is the left's from the next, once that stop is seen let go (LeftInput.latch_gone;
refused otherwise, and the left brakes to its line as any other); from there it is a go that has moved (_after_go: every
road run's band, the crosswalk, the view, a hold, a red), withdrawn to the left's own stop while that stop still ends
HELD_MIN_M short of the junction. No launch, no lift and no post-go profile: the turn's own corner cap holds its speed.

The gap rule (CRITIQUE REQUIRED 2) is on raw detections, never tracks: a distant car that never scores NEW_TRACK_CONF, or
is caught one run in three, never becomes a track, so track absence certifies nothing. Every road camera run's vehicle
boxes at RAW_CONF or more whose bearing lies in the oncoming band (band_blockers), in the road's frame (the car's turned
back by its heading change toward the turn), within R_req by their nearest plausible range, or unranged on the turn side
of straight ahead, break the clear window. It is velocity-free (one pixel of box bottom at 100 m is 7 m of range):
  T_req = GO_LATENCY_S + t_clear(path through the oncoming lanes on the left's post-go profile) + PET_S
          + EXTRA_LANE_S per opposing lane past the first (unknown: two)
  R_req = v_limit x SPEED_MARGIN x T_req + the conflict point's distance (the maneuver point + CONFLICT_PAST_M)
v_limit is the opposing road's mapped limit (navInstruction maneuverOpposingSpeed), DEFAULT_OPPOSING_SPEED when unknown.
A left whose R_req is past the detector's proven range (TurnPilotLeftRangeM; unset, unmeasured: none, so every left; never
past FULL_PASS_RANGE_M, what the letterboxed full pass can box at all: turnpilotd caps it there, and past it the band is the
far slot's, the native schedule's at TurnPilotLeftRangeM or a measured far crop's) is never gone blind: it is driven to its
hold line like any other, and there, judged from where the car stands, it hands back loudly with the car held (undecided,
'range'), never skipped or routed around (Kellen, 2026-11-06: "drive to the line; go where the camera covers the oncoming
road, else hold and hand back loudly; never route around or skip a left for range").
Until then route time refused it (route_range, turn_skip's unprotectedRange) 58-394 m out, before the car could judge
anything, and navd rerouted past the junction onto a route with another left: the 11-06 drives skipped five lefts while
engaged (unprotectedLeft 'skipped' on 2710 frames, never waitGap, creep or go), Chase's "kept wanting to turn left", and a
lane change the driver made toward one of them with no turn behind it ("tried a left and went straight", 1e seg 6).
route_range still says, for the logs, what route time would take R_req as where the car may stand (reach_at_line's setback:
the junction's mapped stop line's, else ROUTE_REACH_MARGIN_M, UNCERTAIN_M of readings' spread: BUILD_FINDINGS D4).
After dark (LeftInput.dark: turnpilotd's darkness.DarkFilter on the road camera's exposure) a left past NIGHT_LEFT_RANGE_M,
what the detector was seen to reach at night (1e: raw vehicle boxes p99 50 m, max 78 m; oncoming tracks first published at
p90 28-53 m), rolled up to its line and handed back there ('night') until 2026-11-07. No night-only gating since (Kellen:
"why the hell do we care about dark? ... the streets are very lit up"): the band is judged at night as by day, and 'night'
is only reach_fault's label in turnpilot.left_reach's short_of.
The far crop (DESIGN phase 4 G5; modeld's FarCrop, tracker.update_far) reaches further: a native-resolution window of the
road frame, aimed (far_aim) at the band's bearings past the full pass's range. While it is on (far_live) its own proven
range (TurnPilotLeftFarRangeM, unset: unmeasured, none) extends the reach, the full pass's measured (it covers the band only
past that range). An R_req past the full pass's range (far_needed)
is then judged on its runs too: one covering those bearings (far_covers, its cover_deg) every FAR_FRESH_S or the window
starts over, STALE_UNDECIDED_S without one a fault (farStale), and any vehicle box of its in the band blocks at any range
(at 230-280 m one pixel of box bottom is 40-56 m and 0.15 deg of pitch is NEAR_PX's whole margin: it never clears a car by
its range). A far slot that runs but can't hold FAR_FRESH_S (1-3 runs a second: a model 2.5-3 ms slower, review 2026-11-07
R2) is behind (far_behind) once the full pass's band has been clear a whole window with the far runs' age alone holding it:
judged from then on that band, as with no far slot, a far box in the band within FAR_BLOCK_RECENT_S still holding it, until
its runs hold FAR_FRESH_S for FAR_BEHIND_CLEAR_S (before, an empty road's left waited at its line forever on them, saying
"Waiting for a gap", where one that didn't run went at once). So waiting on them alone, no band box of a road run within
the full pass's range (no traffic reaching it) and nothing else holding the car, for FAR_BLOCKED_UNDECIDED_S (a far box
FAR_BLOCK_RECENT_S apart keeps the count going) is
said (left_far_wait, its status line), never a handback since 2026-11-07: a car the detector sees holds the left, standing or
coming, and the left keeps waiting for it. Not needed, a far box blocks as the full pass's do. A full pass box
blocks whatever the far runs say. Past both ranges, the far range unmeasured, or the far crop off, it is undecided, saying
which (range, farUnmeasured, farOff; said alike to the driver: the car can't see oncoming far enough), or night after dark.
The band assumes the opposing road straight on from our approach out to R_req: navd's map check of it (straight_m:
routing/controls.py's opposing_straight, the road coming in found on that line every 25 m) must reach R_req from the
junction, or the left is never gone: driven to its hold, it is undecided ('curve') there, the car held; not known is not
straight (skeptic G4: on a road curving away from the turn the band missed a car 80-135 m up).
Nothing here checks the junction's own sightline (a crest, a hedge short of R_req): the demo junction is chosen by eye for
a clear sightline of R_req or more. Held
short of its line (the latch reaches LATCH_NEAR_M short), where the longer crossing puts R_req past the range, the car rolls
up to the line first (ROLL_UP_M; undecided only after ROLL_UP_STALL_S standing in it).
The window (CLEAR_WINDOW_S) counts only road camera runs, from the hold (hold, then judge: never carried from the approach):
a run gap over ROAD_FRESH_S, the scene's holds, an exit crosswalk or view not clear, another of TurnPilot's stops holding the
car at or before the junction (a signal's red, a stop sign: other_hold), or its junction's signal not read green, start it
over (DESIGN G4 go condition 5; skeptic G4). A red or yellow any source reads at the junction (map_controls.turn_light: the
camera's in shadow too, since keeping the car where it stands never brakes it) keeps it waiting, a signal mapped there or not;
at a signal the go needs a green (SIGNAL_NEEDS_GREEN): the left doesn't check the cross traffic, and a model that ran the red
leaves the car at its line in the junction with the oncoming lanes empty at their own red. A green the camera's shadow reader
alone reads lets this go release TurnPilot's latch only: plannerd's lift needs an accepted source's green (turnpilotd.certify_go,
map_controls.release_light), so the model's own red-light hold stays and a shadow green never removes a stop (the light net may
only add one). A signal mapped there with no colour read is 'none' to the left (turn_light, Kellen, 2026-11-07: an unread light
is no reason to wait), so SIGNAL_NEEDS_GREEN holds only where navd can't say whether a signal is there ('unknown'). A red or
yellow read keeps the left waiting at its line for as long as it is read, the light changing from the green it waited on too
(lightChange): held where it stands, short of the oncoming lanes, its window starting over; but one first read with the car
past its line clears the junction on its gap (below: 2026-11-08). A red or yellow that raised
TurnPilot's own signal stop there (the camera's add-only, the car's only source, or an accepted source's) stays the left's
light once no longer read, for as long as that stop is in force (turn_light; a light gone unread keeps a stop): gone on the
green that releases it (a steady camera green for the camera's, an accepted one for an accepted red's). At a junction the map
has no signal for, where no such stop is made (the left's own hold is the junction's), a red or yellow the camera acting or
an accepted source reads there is latched the same (map_controls._left_red_latch, review 2026-11-07 HR-1: it was forgotten
the moment it went unread, and the left went 2.6-3.5 s later on the band empty at its own red, lifted over the model's red
hold), until CAMERA_GREEN_STEADY_S of green there. Only a red the camera's shadow reader alone reads (it adds no stop
anywhere) is gone on the gap once no longer read. Until 2026-11-07 that change, no read for LIGHT_UNKNOWN_S and a red past
LIGHT_RED_MAX_S handed back; now each is said once (left_light_changed, left_light_wait) and waited through. A red held with
nothing read (LeftInput.light_read false: the stop in force, the latch) is said as a through signal's light unseen is,
SIGNAL_UNSEEN_S from the loss, its line SIGNAL_UNSEEN_REASON and one chime (left_light_unseen; review 2026-11-07 AL-2: it
was "Waiting for the light" and silent to LIGHT_RED_MAX_S from the hold, 124 s after the loss); LIGHT_RED_MAX_S is a red still
read. A red or yellow first read with the car past its line (in a signal's junction mouth, or crept into the junction for a
view) is said and heard once, and the car clears the junction as a driver does (Kellen, 2026-11-08; held where it stood
until then): the light is no hold of the left's for that spell (LeftDecision.clearing: turnpilotd lifts its go over the
light and the model's red hold), the go on its gap, a car seen in the band holding it until it passes. "Light changed:
clearing the junction" after a green it stood on, "Red light: clearing the junction" on a light it never read green (LS-4,
LEFTS-3). A red read with the car short of its line, or at it, holds it there for the green as before. Since the review of
2026-11-08 only a car that stood past the line (the mapped signal's own: signal_line_m) on a light not red before the spell
clears (a steady green read there, or CLEAR_STAND_S with no red read); a red first read as it rolls in holds it where its
hold is, for the green; and the clearing go waits for the cross road too (cross_closing: nothing closing within the time it
needs to be out; with no wide camera run, no view of it, a plain-words wait in the mouth, never a handback).
Where plannerd wouldn't lift the go over the model's own hold (turnpilotd.left_lift_refused: at a signal with no accepted
green, which on the car is every signal; where the camera boxes a light with none mapped, HR-2; too near the oncoming lanes
for the lift's nudge; TurnPilotGoOverride off), the go only lets TurnPilot's latch go, so the model has to pull away itself:
there the model's own stop (modelV2.action.shouldStop: a red it sees; LeftInput.model_holds; until 2026-11-08 its takeover
predicate not held, which kept the window from counting at a green where the model waits for the turn the go pulses: drive
29, 461-467 s) holds the left at its line, its window starting over, its line the light's ("Waiting at the light") where a
light is known or boxed at the junction, else
"Waiting for the car to pull away" (a head boxed on the approach alone: LEFTS-4), and its go comes once the model's plan
moves, with the model (review 2026-11-07, LS-2: the go came at the model's red and cantStartTakeControl held the car 1 s later
until a disengage, at every mapped signal on the car). A go of the hold the model then didn't follow is retried the same
way, never bounded, each retry silent and saying what holds the car until the car moves on it, then said and heard as a go
(AL-1: every retry chimed "Turning" on a car that never moved, every 3.85 s).

The view is blocked by an occluder: a velocity-trusted vehicle track standing still in the junction (the opposing
left-turner, a parked truck) whose box hides the oncoming lanes beyond it out to R_req. Its own box isn't traffic (it
would never clear): the raw box overlapping its box in the same camera, or within MATCH_LATERAL_M of it across the ray.
Blocked, with the band otherwise clear, the car creeps (map_controls: CREEP_SPEED, CREEP_ACCEL) up to
CREEP_MAX_M past its line, never nearer than CREEP_SHORT_M short of the oncoming lanes (ONCOMING_ENTRY_M), and stops
creeping where the view clears or a vehicle comes into the band. The exit crosswalk and the junction box (a car standing
in the exit lane would leave the car in the oncoming lanes) must be clear too, and the scene holding nothing.

The hold line is at the nearest of navd's readings of the junction (route_follower: JunctionSpan); the path, the conflict
point and the exit zones take the furthest (spread_m), so a car stopped early never certifies a shorter crossing than it has.
The go (map_controls releases its latch, cause gap; turnpilotd pulses the turn and drives it under the left's post-go
profile): the road camera only from the go to the commit (CRITIQUE REQUIRED 3; the wide camera one run in WIDE_EVERY
while held, for the exit crosswalk). Until the car can no longer stop short of the oncoming lanes on the comfortable curve
(scene_policy.committed_past_line), every road run is checked again for the remaining clear time, and at its first motion
(STANDSTILL_SPEED: CRITIQUE REQUIRED 4) with the latency gone: a car in the band then withdraws the go, the car stops
where the comfortable curve can (oncomingHolding, a chime) and waits again, the go's pulse out of the model's queue as
it is withdrawn (turnpilotd.clear_withdrawn_left), a fresh one at the next go; standing where it was held, it can always
stay. So does anything else the go was certified on no longer holding (the exit crosswalk, the view, another hold, the
light gone red or yellow): a go never outlives them to run stale when they let go. A person overruling the car's left (the
driver's lamp the other way, hazards, our lamp put out: car_signals.py, DESIGN phase4/blinker 6.6) withdraws it the same
while it can (withdrawable: a frame on, VETO_MARGIN_M to spare), and hands back (undecided, driverSignal), the car held
where the comfortable curve stops it, short of the oncoming lanes. It is committed only by its own go and motion (or the
driver's release of the junction, driving it), never by a reading: a scene commit before its go, the car rolling up to its
line or standing held, is a 'position' fault.
Committed, nothing here ever stops the car (a pedestrian in the path still does: scene_policy); committed short of a launch
after a slow one judged on (LEFT_LAUNCH_SPEED), it is carried across the oncoming lanes at its post-go profile (carry,
go_override's: plannerd's lift, never steering, never more than the profile). A lifted go the car hasn't
moved on within turnpilotd's LEFT_NO_MOVE_S is withdrawn and handed back there (the model holding the car under G5's bounded
go). An unlifted one with the model planning no motion that long goes back to a wait at its line (go_unfollowed: its own hold,
a fresh window, never a handback, LS-2); with the model planning motion, the go still out and nothing holding the car,
standing NO_MOVE_S, the car isn't answering: the handback, said. A go it withdraws itself before the car moves ends that
go's clocks there (LEFTS-1).
The left's own hold after a withdrawn go (hold_here: the band, the position fault, a veto) has the latch's release rule
(map_controls._held; owner decisions (a), (b), (c), 2026-10-30), position-free: the car moved by the driver (openpilot
disengaged: the gas, or the brake let off) past where TurnPilot's stop asked it to stand by more than LATCH_PAST_M (metres
inside the ask are TurnPilot's, whoever drove them) or into the oncoming lanes (the room to ONCOMING_ENTRY_M read where the
hold began), or moved by the driver and re-engaged so far on, or so fast, that the hold taken up there could no longer
stand it short of the oncoming lanes (from the re-engage's own speed as the hold's braking takes it, hold_caps through
map_controls.reengage_stop_m), is the driver's: never held again (a re-engage there is never a hold in the oncoming lanes or
the junction), and its crossing is said (crossed: map_controls raises its Driven, the take-control up until the car is
through, turnpilotd's turnMissed for one driven straight on). The lanes are judged at the re-engage, never on the driver's
frames before it: a car the driver brakes to a stand short of the lanes is held there on the re-engage, the full check
going on (c) (skeptic round 2: judged on the driver's frame from the speed then, it was let go for good, and a re-engage
standing short of the lanes pulled the car away across them). Engaged past the re-engage, the plan is TurnPilot's: however
far its own stop carries the car is never the driver's and nothing is let go on it, so a re-engage short of all that is
held there and the full check goes on (c) (skeptic round 1: a re-engage inside the ask was let go a frame or two on, on
TurnPilot's braking, and openpilot drove the car into the junction). So driven, or its hold line's latch let go as the
driver's (driven: the map's Driven for its maneuver), the left is done: undecided ('driven'), no stop, no go, no turn pulse
(TurnPilot never pulses a left nobody checked, and a pulse of a withdrawn go still out comes out of the model's queue under
TURN_STARTED_DEG into it: turnpilotd.clear_driven_left, the car going straight on, missed), the crossing's prompt said.
