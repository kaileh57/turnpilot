"""The stop-sign decider (STOP_SIGNS.md v3 sections 2, 4.5, 4.6, 6, 7.1; SG4a, the core): at a held stop sign, whether and
when the car goes by itself, and its launch across the junction. turnpilotd runs it every frame between the turn tuple and
map_update (StopGo.update), so its release, the end of shouldStop and its go reach one plan.

What it decides from (Frame): the stop control in hand (map_controls.held_control(), keyed on its state object, which a
reroute's adopt carries over, so the same control keeps its decider; O8), or the engaged stop sign ahead within STOP_SWEEP_M
(a queue); its junction (stop_rules.Junction from junctionInfo); the tracker's tracks (its own StopEvidence) and the scene's
objects; the live visibility turnpilotd's junction watch feeds every run (visibility.LiveVisibility); this tick's runs (the
signal-head check); the visibility file, the surveys and the wall clock; the car's speed, acceleration, odometer, yaw and
steering; the model (the takeover predicate: go_override.Takeover, imported, never restated); and G5's go in hand.

Modes (TurnPilotStopSignGo, decision D4). auto and trial act. off and shadow (H6), a value or a param this build doesn't know
(H6, said), auto without step S1's camera fields or without a passing launchVerified (H4; trial skips only the latter), a lens
a consumer reports differently from the file's (refused, loudly: H4), and no current stop-sign sidecar at the junction (H8)
act as shadow: map_controls keeps its 1 s stopSignTakeControl handback exactly as before, the reason saying why, and the
decider computes would_go only (logged once a stop). Acting:

- approach: the engaged stop within STOP_SWEEP_M. Standing in a queue with no lead and short of the line (V1, O2), up to
  ROLLUP_GOES rollUp goes (G5) while the model holds; the map curve rolls the car up, never a stop ahead of a standing car.
- stopped: latched; the full stop's dwell (STOP_DWELL_S, within LINE_M of the stop point). Latched more than LINE_M short (O2)
  is rollUp: the latch's stop point moved on to the stop point on map_controls' creep path (creep), the map curve its cap up
  to ROLLUP_V_MAX, with rollUp goes while the model holds. The arrival is the full stop: a vehicle already standing at another
  approach's line is earlier (V5), in the order first seen stopped; one stopping within TIE_S after it is a tie (V6: yield to
  the right; facing, straight or right before left; another car assumed straight). One standing at its line, or up to
  PARKED_BACK_M back, PARKED_S while others take turns is parked (V18): no rank, never a shield, still an occluder.
- observe: section 2.4's go conditions every frame (go_holds: each one held a Hold with its reason and kind, the wait ledger of
  4.6). All of them for CLEAR_S is the go: map_controls' latch let go (release, cause 'clear', no span release past it), G5's
  go (go_cause stopSign) and the stopGo chime. Waiting is silent (waitingForCross, its reason) with an info chime at
  WAIT_INFO_S and every WAIT_INFO_S after while dynamic; a static wait has STATIC_WAIT_S, then the ladder (7.1): rung 1, the
  creep for a view (2.5, G3: VIEW_CREEP_M steps on the latch's creep path where the walk predicted from there gains the
  binding lane and the creep floor allows it, measured CLEAR_S after each), rung 2, another maneuver synthesized from the
  junction's approaches that certifies here (3.5: a right from a lane that can turn right, straight or a left only from a
  single-lane approach; said, otherTurn, and the route's planned turn published missed once done), rung 3, H3 with the
  reason. A dynamic wait past WAIT_ALT_S takes another maneuver whose every go condition holds now (O12). A person standing
  at a crosswalk's curb holds the go PED_CURB_S, then the car goes at STOP_GO_V_MAX until past that crosswalk (D3, P3, P15).
  A control the route couldn't avoid (junctionInfo.certification
  unavoidable: announced at route start and 300 m before) is H3 "this stop needs you" right after the full stop whatever the
  line reads, and one the route found uncertifiable (avoidance off) is H3 there once the line can't certify it either (7.1).
  The deadlock (4.5 step 5, V9, V10): an earlier arrival that holds its turn DEADLOCK_S with nothing in the
  junction moving gets one signalling creep of DEADLOCK_CREEP_M on the latch's creep path (DEADLOCK_CREEP_V, a G5 go with
  cause creep, never closer than GO_ROOM_M to the closest plausible edge, never while creep_blocked: V12, V13), then the
  order is waived and every other go condition still holds for CLEAR_S; it moving before our commit stops us short and we
  yield (during the creep the latch holds again; during the launch the re-check's capped abort); a creep something else cut
  short (anything moving in the junction, the corner no longer clear: the earlier arrival didn't move) is given back and
  taken again DEADLOCK_S after nothing moves, up to DEADLOCK_CREEP_TRIES creeps an encounter. With nothing moving
  DEADLOCK_S and no creep able to run (another go condition holding the go, or the encounter's creeps spent), the turn is a
  static cause (4.6: only traffic taking turns waits with no bound): STATIC_WAIT_S, then H3. Off the route (O9) the
  maneuver is unknown, the union of the conflict sets: navd's reroute is waited for up to OFFROUTE_WAIT_S from the full stop
  (a dynamic wait, its static causes' clock running on), then the union decides and the ladder runs if it fails.
- going: TurnPilot's cap STOP_GO_V_MAX until the commit point, every object, view and sector re-checked (lane reach on the
  go position's geometry, decision D13; a track known at the go judged by its ground motion since, as bearings from a moving
  car restart its trust; any new one in a conflicting lane, or a raw box no known track explains, withdraws the go); the
  takeover gate (the model must have taken over by the gate point) and G5's window. A withdrawn go is the capped abort (an
  accel cap of max(needed, -2.0) to M_EDGE short of dEdgeMin and a speed cap of 0, the way map_controls._approach stops; never
  scene_policy.stop(confirmed=False), whose exponential stop overruns), then observe again with the rank kept, a new go while
  GO_ROOM_M remains, GO_RETRIES retries, then H5. A model that took over and stands again before commit is the same (O5).
- committed (the band, to the in-lane point): a full stop un-commits (V26: observe, never clearBox); a vehicle that would reach
  our conflict point before we clear its lane plus BAND_ABORT_MARGIN_S is the capped abort only where it ends short of the
  band midpoint, else carried on (said: crossTrafficAfterCommit).
- inLane: carried on, never braked for a cross car (crossTrafficAfterCommit); standing STALL_BOX_S with nothing of TurnPilot's
  holding it, up to CLEAR_BOX_GOES clearBox goes once the lanes left to cross pass their object tests (stalledInJunction),
  then H5.
- The views: stopSweep from STOP_SWEEP_M before the control to the commit point (turnpilotd's speed gate on it), stopSweepGo
  from the commit point until the rear bumper is past the farthest conflicting lane or the car has turned 60 deg.

Vision (TurnPilotStopSignGo=vision; owner decision 2026-10-30 18:20, "vision based go"; tp/vision-go's spec): every piece of
the live machinery above runs, and only the certification gates are bypassed: the survey (and its caps), the validation
stamp, S1's camera fields (the noMask zero) and launchVerified. In their place the vision gate (_vision_gate: a visibility
file, its lens, no rail crossing at the junction; nothing else certify fails a route for is a gate, and a junction the map
has nothing for is judged as a plain cross road, stop_rules.assumed_cross) and a reach floor per lane
(stop_rules.reach_needed_vision on the walk's raw reach, PV1's optimistic row, no mask needed). The side views are used when
they run and never waited for (_view_holds, _side_out): the forward views alone are a fault's to lose. After dark it runs as by day
(Kellen, 2026-11-07: "why the hell do we care about dark?"): night, dusk and no clock walk the day table (stop_rules.walk_row),
the side views' live sectors zeroing only a bearing that reads washed or frozen (the camera seeing nothing there; a dark,
blocked or degraded sector never, at any lighting row: every side view reads dark at a night stand, a dim still one by day
blocked, and ordinary footage at 70-85 deg degraded; review 2026-11-07 LS-3 and LS-3-R1, wf7 verify:LS-3-R1 point 4,
visibility.VISION_ACCEPT); until then the gate failed every stop after dark ("Stop sign: night at ETA +0 min: take control",
H9) and the walk on the 'night' row, which has no table, read every lane's reach 0 (the note above stop_rules.DARK_ROWS). The
light at the line (low sun, the sun ahead) is no gate either: the walk
zeroes the glare's bearings and the views judge the rest, a side view's sector that reads washed out or frozen inside the
sun's zone, short of a lane's floor, that lane's why as on a plain day (visibility.LiveVisibility.lanes: glare is never less
careful than no glare).

A lane short of its floor under vision (the review of 2026-11-08; Kellen, 2026-11-07: "no, no handbacks", a vision-based go like
early Autopilot, imperfect OK, not aggressive) is what a careful driver does about it, never H3: a wait on reach alone is the
creep for a view VISION_CREEP_AFTER_S into it, where a step shows more (_step_shows_more: an occluder in the way, or the
walk predicting VIEW_CREEP_GAIN_M more; _view_step: VIEW_CREEP_M at a time on the latch's creep path at VIEW_CREEP_V,
Creeping for view, never while creep_blocked, never closer to the closest plausible edge than a go from there needs to stop
short of it with a step's run-on to spare), each stand read VIEW_MEASURE_S (the go on its own once every lane meets its
floor), and once no step shows more or can start (_view_limit: no room, no latch, a step that didn't move the car) the car
goes on what it sees (view_limited): each lane judged by its tracks and raw boxes alone, a car seen in one holding the go
(and on the launch withdrawing it), the long look's window and "Look both ways" before the go. That holds whatever ended the
lane's walk: the frame's edge, an occluder, a side view not running, or one that reads washed out or frozen (_seen_enough).
A stand with no room for a go that could stop short of the closest plausible edge
goes committed from there (_rest_go) once the window has run, never H5; a vehicle or a person standing in the junction or just
ahead holds the go as a wait with no bound, never H3; the car's yaw on its approach is the walk's rotation bound, no hold. Every lane is judged as
possibly not stopping (the tracked test for every track, no on-site downgrade), a car at its line on an approach the map says
stops is a shield (stop_evidence's vision_shield), and the go comes after VISION_CLEAR_S, announced VISION_ANNOUNCE_S before
("Going"). A conflicting approach over 25 mph or of unknown speed is the long look (owner direction 2026-10-30 19:15-19:55):
its floor judged at 25 mph, the window VISION_LONG_CLEAR_S, the creep to the best view first, "Look both ways" announced. A
gate that fails before the first go is the 1 s handback saying which ("Stop sign: a rail crossing 20 m away: take control", H9); after
it, a held fault (H9), never shadow (C14). ALWAYS_DRIVE's amendments V1-V10 hold under vision alone (each marked V<n> below);
the other four modes are as they were (tests/test_stop_go_modes_golden.py). The go's line is said on VISION_ANNOUNCE_S of
acting, engaged frames in a row before it: re-engaged (or acting again) with the window already run, the line comes first and
the go VISION_ANNOUNCE_S after it, never on the re-engaged frame. SAT-11, under vision alone: every vehicle standing at the go is
watched for its start (_watch_starts: its ground point and speed toward our path, our own motion taken out), its start before
the commit withdrawing the go and after it a threat in the band; and from the commit point on, a confirmed vehicle in our path
corridor ahead (in it, or entering it within RAIL_ENTER_S and still there when we reach it) is the in-path rail (_rail): the
car stopped short of it, as hard as it needs, "Car crossing" said loudly (carCrossing), in a cross lane too, since a car is
entering our own path; V8's carrying on is for the cross cars that aren't. A stand it leaves is the stall's clearBox lifts.
The rail judges a vehicle by its measured motion, never its vy alone (skeptic round 1: a car waiting at the opposite line and
one parked at the exit kerb, their vy reading toward us, stood the car hard in the junction): only one whose ground point came
toward our axis over its matches, beyond the camera's drift on a standing car we pass, has its body across our corridor
(_rail_motion, _corridor), and the hard tier is scene_policy's TrackEvidence.confirmed, steadiness included.

Faults (7.1), each stopSignTakeControl with its reason, the car held (by the latch, or by the decider's own stop once the latch
has let go): H1 a needed view without a run for DET_FAULT_S (under vision the forward views alone are needed; held:
cameraPaused for FAULT_GRACE_S first; moving before commit, the capped abort first), H2 the position unknown (no or a failed
junctionInfo, navd's fixes spread over 2 x POS_ERR_M on the last 20 m before the latch, or the latch more than H2_LINE_M from a
surveyed stop point with no queue; a step of navd's position, a GPS jump that stays or comes back, is no spread: the stop is
the fresh reading's and the car stops, looks and goes, only readings that keep disagreeing or drift apart are the fault
(settled_spread); held: junctionUncertain
for FAULT_GRACE_S first), H3, H5, H7 (a person in the 0-3 m front zone not
seen leaving, across views, FRONT_ZONE_MAX_S: the hold is the rail, the handback asks the driver to look where no camera
can). Under vision what is left of H3 and H5 is a fault's (the driver's signal against the ladder's other turn, the model
not taking over a go or a roll-up, the car stalled in the junction) and of H9 the gate's (a rail crossing, no visibility
file, a lens mismatch); none is a judgement of what the cameras can see. Every hold
on a standing car is scene_policy.stop(confirmed=False); every abort is the capped stop; nothing here asks for less than -2.0
m/s^2. The decider survives faults as the latch does (turnpilotd rebuilds it only in reset(detector=True)); the driver
disengaging during the launch ends its encounter (O6, O7).

A one-way cross road (G9, V22): only its legal approach conflicts for cars, and its illegal side (a leg cars only leave by,
stop_rules.wrong_way_lanes) is watched: a track there not yet trusted, or coming toward our path, blocks the go (a driver
going the wrong way, or a cyclist, on a contraflow bike lane or not); during the launch any new track there, or a known one
the tracker's ground motion brings nearer, withdraws it, and in the band it is the in-band rule's threat.

Evidence on site (4.4, decision D11): a motor vehicle through a stopping approach's line at DOWNGRADE_V or more (its speed
trusted, never under it in the DOWNGRADE_WINDOW_M before; never a bicycle) makes that approach no for the rest of the
encounter at once (go_holds: "cross traffic doesn't stop", a static wait, then H3; before commit a go out is withdrawn for it,
never once committed), and on_downgrade (turnpilotd) writes it to TurnPilotJunctionOverrides with its evidence; a vehicle that
stops at its line and goes on is a stop event, logged only.

Phantom clears are what the go conditions are about: no detections in a lane says nothing (visibility.py's positive walk), an
untrusted track is never stopping, a raw box blocks before it is a track, a stale view resets CLEAR_S, the shield needs a
vehicle seen stopped on every cycle at a surveyed stopping approach, and the junction must certify by routing/certify.assess
(navd's own function; its reach check replaced by the live walk), with the side views live if its reach relied on them.
