"""Scene policy: tracked pedestrians and cars into longitudinal limits.

The driving model keeps lane keeping, leads, lights and the turn itself. This covers what it doesn't: a
pedestrian in or entering the path, a pedestrian at the crosswalk a curb-side turn crosses, and oncoming
traffic at a turn across it (every such turn is treated as unprotected). Each becomes a stop point; the
tightest one wins and is turned into a speed cap on a comfortable braking curve, plus an accel cap when that
curve can't make it. shouldStop is only set at the stop point near standstill, because longcontrol's stopping
state ignores the accel target and ramps the brakes on its own.

A track is evidence, not fact: a stop that needs harder braking than the curve only gets it from a confirmed track
(enough hits at a high enough confidence, or many hits at any, CONFIRM_RECENT_HITS of them in the last CONFIRM_WINDOW_S on
every frame, the detector still matching it, and published on every frame since: ScenePolicy.update_evidence), so a
two-hit false positive, or a burst the tracker coasts on, slows the car on the curve
instead of stopping it hard, and the accel cap ramps in at a bounded jerk rather than stepping. A confirmed person moving
along the path is followed like a lead, not stopped for, and one on a confirmed, moving bicycle or motorcycle is its
rider, left to the driving model like any vehicle; an unconfirmed track's velocity is mostly range noise, so it never
turns a stop into a follow. Nor is any pedestrian track's velocity faster than a person runs (PED_MAX_SPEED): ScenePolicy
reads such a track as standing, so it is neither walking into the path nor followed (turnpilotScene keeps the tracker's
velocity for everyone else). A crosswalk hold needs a steadily detected track with enough hits. It holds for anyone who
might step into the turn's crosswalk, standing or moving: only a confirmed track walking away from it (on past the
maneuver point, or away down the cross street) is let go. A track's evidence is kept while the tracker may still match
it again under the same id (KEEP_EVIDENCE_S), not just while it is published.

No scene is no evidence, never a reason to hold: a missing detector is turnpilotd's to hand back (a soft disable), not
this policy's to stop for. Nor is it a reason to release: ScenePolicy keeps the stops in force when the scene went
away, dead-reckoned with the car's speed, until it comes back. The driver taking over at the hold line (a gas press with
openpilot disengaged: DisengageOnAccelerator, turnpilotd.py) releases the junction hold for that maneuver, not just
while it's held: otherwise re-engaging brings the hold back, inside the junction if the car went past the line. A gas
press with openpilot still engaged is never a go (no gas go, 2026-10-28). Past the hold line a turn is committed for good once stopping in the
junction is worse than finishing it (committed_past_line): a curb-side turn faster than COMMIT_SPEED, a far-side one
once it can't stop short of the oncoming lanes on the comfortable curve, so the oncoming hold still stops a car pulling
away from the line on its go (BeamNG: it held only because the car happened to be under 2 m/s there). Not a curb-side turn
whose crosswalk hold, confirmed for its walker and in force since (ScenePolicy.crosswalk_id), is braking the car over the
line: finishing that turn is entering the crosswalk with her in it (BeamNG R3, ped_crosswalk_right at 6ba8582: first
tracked 5.1 m off, she was held for from 11.3 m out at 4.7 m/s, the car crossed its line at 2.66 m/s, committed, and the
hold let go of her for good), so the hold stops the car where it can past the line and stands it there while anyone still
holds it; once no one does, the turn goes on and commits as any other. Slowing
later in the junction never brings a far-side turn's oncoming hold back. A person does hold a committed curb-side turn:
a walker in its crosswalk zone first tracked, or tracked again, with the car past its line (her track lapses there: she is
outside the road camera's view at the corner until the wide camera runs) stops it short of her for as long as it still can
(late_walkers: she is by the lane the turn enters, ahead of the bumper, and the car stops within her range on the
comfortable curve), a walker-grade track as any crosswalk hold's, braked for on that curve alone; past that the turn is
finished. Pedestrians in the path stop it as ever. ScenePolicy keeps
those and the rest of what one frame can't know; scene_policy() is one frame on its own.
A turnpilotd fault (fault()) loses the route, and with it the maneuver a junction hold is for: the hold in force then
stays where it was, dead-reckoned like a carried pedestrian stop, until a live scene judges the junction again with the
route back, the car is committed past it, or the driver takes over at it. A junction the car was committed to or released
into stays so when the route is back under a new id, the car at it.

Cross traffic at a turn with no mapped control (ScenePolicy.update's cross_yield, turnpilotd's: no stop sign, yield or
signal mapped at the turn's junction, no light head read there, the stop-sign decider not acting): the turn enters or
crosses a road nothing stops for it, a T's stem the commonest, so it yields to the vehicles the cameras track closing on its
path along that road, from either side for a far-side turn and from the side away from the turn for a curb-side one
(cross_stops). The judgement is the stop-sign go's tracked test (stop_rules.tracked_ok: the vehicle can stop short of our
path and leaves its gap, T_GAP), on the scene's own tracks and trust: a trusted track by its measured speed toward our path,
moving across more than along; a new one (VEL_TRUST_HITS) beyond our own road's lanes (CROSS_Y_NEAR_M) taken as closing at
ONCOMING_ASSUMED_SPEED and held for on the comfortable curve only, as the oncoming hold's. The hold is a hold-line stop like
the oncoming one, the car to stop short of the cross road's near lane (cross_hold_stop, CROSS_ENTRY_M); it lasts while such
a vehicle is tracked and CROSS_CLEAR_S after the last one seen closing by its own motion (the go's clear window), so an
empty road never stands the car and nothing is handed back for it.

Objects are TurnpilotScene.TrackedObject (or anything with the same fields): x m forward, y m LEFT in the
calibrated frame, vx/vy over-ground velocity in that frame (ego motion removed), cls compared by name, inPath
set by the tracker, age its hits. If a tracker publishes velocity relative to the car instead, a parked car ahead
reads as oncoming and the junction hold is conservative, not missed. Nor is a new track's vx trusted for the oncoming
hold: until VEL_TRUST_HITS a vehicle in the oncoming lanes is taken as coming at ONCOMING_ASSUMED_SPEED, and held for on
the comfortable curve only: a parked car or a ghost of a few frames never brakes the car hard.

Hard braking (Kellen, 2026-10-28: confirmed in-path pedestrian and oncoming stops may brake as hard as they need, "but be
careful, phantom emergency braking is really dangerous"). Only these stops ever ask for more than -2.0 m/s^2, the floor
of every map, light and speed-cap stop, and only from a confirmed track: CONFIRM_HITS matched detections at CONFIRM_CONF
or more, or CONFIRM_STEADY_HITS at any (a track starts only at the tracker's NEW_TRACK_CONF), CONFIRM_RECENT_HITS of them within
CONFIRM_WINDOW_S, kept only while that still holds and the detector still matches it (HARD_MISSED_RUNS, LOST_CLOSE_M: a coast
is no detection) and the track is published (a phantom seen once a second never confirms), ranged (the tracker
publishes only tracks with a ground position), in the path (in_path), or for the oncoming hold also VEL_TRUST_HITS so
its motion is the tracker's, not range noise. A track the tracker published for one detector frame (MIN_HITS) or a
few never does: its stop brakes on the comfortable curve (no accel cap, a speed cap no lower than STOP_DECEL takes).
Every hard brake is logged at its start with the track's evidence (turnpilot.hard_brake) and is raised to the driver
(SceneDecision.hard_brake: turnpilotd's controlAlert hardBrake).
In the path, for this rule, includes the crosswalk the turn is about to cross (Kellen's reading, delegated 2026-10-30: "we
don't want to kill Chase but we do want a good demo"; BUILD_FINDINGS N2): a confirmed walker in the turn side's crosswalk
zone (junction_stops) is in the turn's path though in_path's corridor straight ahead doesn't hold them, so the crosswalk
hold may harden on that walker's confirmation alone (may_harden=confirmed_track), as BeamNG S03's hold did for a confirmed
walker 2.7 m to the turn side (in_path false). Everything else about it stands: confirmed, ranged, published, steady.

A person by the road (owner decision, 2026-10-30: BUILD_FINDINGS D3-real option 2, TurnPilotCurbPedCap, on by default): a
published person track with a crosswalk hold's steadiness (TrackEvidence.walker: CROSSWALK_HITS at CROSSWALK_CONF and
CROSSWALK_STEADY_HITS within CROSSWALK_STEADY_S) within CURB_PED_EDGE_M of the path's edge (under PATH_HALF_WIDTH_M plus that
from the model's path, update()'s path) and CURB_PED_X_M ahead caps the speed at CURB_PED_SPEED: a side-on person 15-30 m out
is scored reliably only inside about 15 m (DETECTOR_DIAG), so the car comes past her slowly enough for a late detection to
stop it. Through the speed cap alone, eased so nothing from it asks for more than -CURB_PED_DECEL: no accel cap, never a stop,
never the hard tier. It holds while such a track is published and lets go CURB_PED_HOLD_S after the last; logged once a track
(turnpilot.curb_ped_cap). The track is kept as any other, so her confirmation is warm if she steps out; nothing about
confirmation, the tracker or what stops the car changes. Replayed over 16.4 min of public comma four footage through the real
tracker it took no false track (the nearest, a roadside object, came 2.38 m off the path with 4 hits) and one real person.

Tracker B's people (TurnPilotFarPeds, scene/tracker_b.py; PERCEPTION_PLAN item 5, peds P3 variant g:C): ScenePolicy.update takes
them after the scene's (extra_objects), each b_only, its trackId offset by B_ID and its age 0. A b_only object is never confirmed
or earned (no hard tier, no following stop) and never a crosswalk walker or a curb-cap track, whatever its fields say, so all
it can ever do is a "pedestrian in path" stop on the STOP_DECEL curve: a TurnPilot veto for a person the far crop saw first,
never a gate. Its stop is soft (Stop.soft): never asking for more than STOP_DECEL, the speed cap's lag included (an unconfirmed
track's other stops brake on the curve too, but the lagged speed cap can ask up to SPEED_CAP_ACCEL_MIN, -1.7 m/s^2 on a KITTI
replay tick of one), carried so through a stale scene. The pedestrian velocity trust (trusted_velocity) reads it as it reads the
scene's.

A person who may be in front (WARGAME_FIXES WF-13; BeamNG SAT validation row 6, ped_step_out-20261031-084546 at 263065a: the car
stood 2.9 m short of a walker for her confirmed track, the track coasted CLOSE_HOLD_S on no hits and ended with her still
standing below the bonnet line, and TurnPilot's straight release drove the car past her 0.93 m off her centre). A pedestrian
track TurnPilot stopped for (TrackEvidence.stood, stood_for: a pedestrian stop for it braked the car while it moved and brought
it to rest, in force all along; one in force only while something else stood the car, a red or a stop sign, is no stop of
TurnPilot's for it, so a 2-hit reflection seen at a red sets nothing) or that earned confirmation, whose last new hit was in
front of the car (in_front: up to PERSON_FRONT_X_M ahead, the tracker's close hold's reach, in the path's corridor, or ahead of
the bumper within PERSON_FRONT_MARGIN_M of it, straight ahead or the model's path), and that ends (no longer published: lost,
coasted out, aged out) with the car at PERSON_FRONT_SPEED or slower and the driver not driving, sets ScenePolicy.person_front.
While it is set a stop holds the car standing, or brings it to rest on the comfortable curve (soft: never more than STOP_DECEL;
the track was confirmed or its stop had brought the car to rest, so no phantom's), first among the stops so its reason,
PERSON_FRONT_NOTE, is the decision's; turnpilotd bars every go of its own on it and hands back after its bound. It ends only on
the driver (update's driver: openpilot disengaged or the gas pressed) or once everyone it was set for has been seen leaving, and
after that nothing person-like (a person or cyclist track in front of the car, or a raw person box near: update's raw_people,
turnpilotd's) for PERSON_FRONT_CLEAR_S on live frames. Seen leaving is tied to her (skeptic round 1's B1: at ed9e31d any track
new since, in front once and clear once, cleared it, so a second walker crossing in front and gone let the car drive through
where she stood unseen): a pedestrian track not published when it was set (someone already tracked elsewhere then is someone
else), whose first new hit since was in front of the car within PERSON_FRONT_MATCH_M of where one of them was lost
(PersonFront.lost: her last new hit, a road place, the car's travel since taken off by ScenePolicy.odo), and which then has
PERSON_FRONT_LEAVING_HITS new hits in a row clear of the corridor by the margin (clear_of_path: a coast drifting out is no hit,
one outlier hit no leaving), accounts for the one nearest its first hit. A track first seen off the corridor or further from
them is someone else for good; one of them seen again and lost in front again is where it ended. No scene, or raw boxes not
known (raw_people None, a fault's update), runs no clock: no evidence is never a reason to release. A track that ends further
out or off the corridor, or a walker seen walking clear before her track ends, sets none, and the stops are as before.
