  TurnPilot's alerts share one slot, at most one of them a frame, by this priority:
  1. a handback (turnpilotDetectorStopped, turnpilotNoDetector, turnpilotModelFellBack; handback.py): nothing here while one is set;
  2. a fault (turnpilotUnavailable);
  3. a map stop it can't make gently (turnpilotControlAlert, cannotStopComfortably: take control), or off the route with
     the map stops ahead unknown (offRouteStopsUnknown: the speed capped, take control or wait for the reroute);
  4. too fast to turn (turnpilotTooFastToTurn);
  5. a map control's prompt to the driver (turnpilotControlPrompt: stop sign, signal or unprotected turn go, yield ahead);
  6. a map control's other alerts (turnpilotControlAlert: a stop line overrun, going on a yellow or a red, an unprotected
     turn's junction uncertain);
  7. a planned lane change, offered or just aborted (turnpilotLaneChangeLeft/Right/Aborted, LaneChangeEvents);
  8. the wrong lane, or a lane it can't confirm (turnpilotWrongLane);
  9. the map controls' status (turnpilotControlAlert: map stops unavailable, light source rejected).
  The alerts of 4 to 9 are all Priority.LOW or lower, where AlertManager shows the newest, so the order is kept by not
  raising the lower ones: the wrong lane isn't raised while a lane change is offered or its abort holds (the car is in a
  turn-only lane at an intersection before the turn the change is for), and lane_change_events raises nothing while the
  plan is too fast to turn, faulted or has a map control's prompt or alert up (the skip drops the maneuver, so its offer
  aborts that same frame, and the skip says why).
  turnpilotd keeps the lower ones unset while it isn't acting or is faulted (turnpilotd.py). A handback cancels an
  offered lane change with its abort (turnpilotLaneChangeAborted, reason handedBack), raised with it: on screen the
  engaged handback's soft disable (Priority.MID) outranks it, and while disengaged the abort (a WARNING) isn't shown.
  A fault is a WARNING with a chime while engaged, held TURNPILOT_FAULT_ALERT_S so a one-frame fault is heard and read
  (selfdrived/events.py), and PERMANENT at Priority.LOWER while not."""
